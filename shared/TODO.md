# Shared Components - ‚úÖ **INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE**

## 1. üéØ Overview & Learning Objectives

This directory contains shared libraries, Protocol Buffer definitions, and other cross-cutting concerns that are used by multiple microservices. The goal is to promote code reuse, consistency, and best practices across the entire platform.

### **Why create shared components?**

*   **Consistency**: Ensures that all services use the same logging format, authentication mechanism, etc.
*   **Reusability**: Avoids duplicating code in every service.
*   **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to update common functionality in one place.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **API Design with Protocol Buffers**: Learn how to design and manage API contracts for a large microservices architecture.
*   **Shared Library Design**: Understand the principles of creating reusable libraries for cross-cutting concerns.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture**: Design and implement event schemas for a distributed system.

## 2. üöÄ Implementation Plan

### **Week 1: Protocol Buffers & gRPC**

*   **Goal**: Define the gRPC service contracts and event schemas using Protocol Buffers.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Service Contracts**: Define the gRPC service contracts for all our microservices in the `proto` directory.
    *   [ ] **Event Schemas**: Define the schemas for our Kafka events.
    *   [ ] **Code Generation**: Set up a script to automatically generate the gRPC client and server code for all our languages.

### **Week 2: Common Libraries**

*   **Goal**: Implement shared libraries for common cross-cutting concerns.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**: Create a library to handle JWT validation and RBAC.
    *   [ ] **Logging & Observability**: Implement a structured logging library that includes correlation IDs and integrates with our tracing system.
    *   [ ] **Database Abstractions**: Create a library to manage database connections and transactions.
    *   [ ] **Configuration Management**: Implement a library for loading and validating environment-based configurations.

## 3. üìÅ Directory Structure

-  `events/`: Contains event-specific documentation and schemas.
-  `libs/`: Contains the source code for our shared libraries, organized by language.
-  `proto/`: Contains all our Protocol Buffer definitions.
-  `templates/`: Contains templates for creating new services.
