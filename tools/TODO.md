# Tools - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. üéØ Overview & Learning Objectives

This directory contains tools and scripts that help with the development, testing, and deployment of our microservices. The goal is to automate as much of the development lifecycle as possible to improve developer productivity and reduce errors.

### **Why create custom tools?**

*   **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like creating new services, running tests, and deploying to different environments.
*   **Consistency**: Ensure that all services are created and managed in a consistent way.
*   **Efficiency**: Streamline the development workflow.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **Developer Tooling**: Learn how to build tools that improve the developer experience.
*   **Scripting & Automation**: Gain experience in writing scripts to automate complex tasks.
*   **Code Generation**: Learn how to use code generation to scaffold new services and components.

## 2. üöÄ Implementation Plan

### **Week 1: Service Generator**

*   **Goal**: Create a tool for generating new microservices from a template.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Template Design**: Design a template for a new microservice that includes a standard directory structure, build scripts, and a basic "hello world" implementation.
    *   [ ] **Generator Script**: Write a script that takes a service name as input and generates a new service from the template.

### **Week 2: Testing & Deployment Scripts**

*   **Goal**: Create scripts for testing and deploying our services.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Test Script**: Write a script that can run the tests for a single service or for all services.
    *   [ ] **Deployment Script**: Write a script that can deploy a service to our Kubernetes cluster.
