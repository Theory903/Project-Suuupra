# **Service PRD: VOD Service**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> The Suuupra platform needs to provide a high-quality, on-demand video streaming experience for its users. This requires a robust and scalable video processing and delivery pipeline that can handle a large volume of videos, transcode them into multiple formats and bitrates, and deliver them to users with low latency and high reliability. The challenge is to build a VOD service that can provide a seamless and engaging video experience, while also supporting advanced features like DRM and content-aware encoding.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class VOD service that provides a high-quality, on-demand video streaming experience for all users on the Suuupra platform.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Video Processing** | The system can ingest, transcode, and process videos in various formats. |
| FR-2  | **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming** | The system can deliver video in multiple bitrates to adapt to the user's network conditions. |
| FR-3  | **DRM & Security** | The system can protect content with DRM and other security measures. |
| FR-4  | **CDN Distribution** | The system can distribute content globally using a multi-CDN architecture. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Video Startup Time** | <2s | A fast startup time is critical for a good user experience. Challenge: Optimizing the video delivery pipeline and CDN configuration. |
| NFR-2 | **Rebuffer Rate** | <1% | A low rebuffer rate is essential for a smooth viewing experience. Challenge: Implementing adaptive bitrate streaming and a multi-CDN strategy. |
| NFR-3 | **Scalability** | 10,000+ concurrent streams | The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent streams. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture for video processing and delivery. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Transcoding Failure:** What happens if a transcoding job fails? (e.g., the system should automatically retry the job and, if it continues to fail, alert the operations team).
*   **DRM License Failure:** What happens if a user is unable to obtain a DRM license? (e.g., the system should provide a clear error message and instructions on how to resolve the issue).
*   **CDN Outage:** What happens if a CDN provider has an outage? (e.g., the system should automatically failover to another CDN provider).
