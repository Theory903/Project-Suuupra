## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> The Suuupra platform needs to deliver high-quality, low-latency live video to millions of concurrent viewers. Traditional streaming protocols and architectures are not sufficient to handle this scale and provide a good user experience. The challenge is to build a massively scalable live streaming service that can deliver a near-real-time viewing experience to a global audience.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class live streaming platform that can deliver high-quality, low-latency live video to millions of concurrent viewers, enabling us to host large-scale live events and classes.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Live Streaming** | The system can ingest, transcode, and deliver live video streams to a large audience. |
| FR-2  | **Low-Latency Streaming** | The system uses LL-HLS to deliver a near-real-time viewing experience. |
| FR-3  | **Multi-CDN Distribution** | The system uses a multi-CDN architecture for global content delivery. |
| FR-4  | **Scalability & Redundancy** | The system is horizontally scalable and resilient to failures. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Latency** | <5s | Low latency is critical for a live streaming experience. Challenge: Implementing LL-HLS and optimizing the delivery pipeline. |
| NFR-2 | **Scalability** | 1M+ concurrent viewers | The system must be able to handle a massive number of concurrent viewers. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture with load-balanced ingestion points and a multi-CDN setup. |
| NFR-3 | **Availability** | 99.99% | The live streaming service must be highly available, especially during large-scale events. Challenge: Implementing a resilient and fault-tolerant architecture. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Ingestion Failure:** What happens if an ingestion point fails? (e.g., the system should automatically failover to a redundant ingestion point).
*   **Transcoding Failure:** What happens if a transcoding worker fails? (e.g., the system should automatically restart the transcoding job on a new worker).
*   **CDN Failure:** What happens if a CDN provider fails? (e.g., the system should automatically route traffic to other healthy CDNs).

```

### **3.2. Tech Stack Deep Dive**

| Component | Technology | Version | Justification & Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language/Framework** | `Go` | `1.21` | High performance and concurrency for a high-throughput streaming service. |
| **Media Processing** | `FFmpeg` | `5.x` | The swiss-army knife of media processing for real-time transcoding. |
| **Streaming Protocol** | `LL-HLS` | - | For low-latency streaming with standard HTTP delivery. |

### **3.3. API Design**

*   **Ingestion:** RTMP endpoint (e.g., `rtmp://live.suuupra.com/app/{stream_key}`).
*   **Playback:** HLS manifest URL (e.g., `https://cdn.suuupra.com/live/{stream_id}/master.m3u8`).
*   **API:**
    *   `POST /api/v1/streams`: Create a new live stream, returns stream key.
    *   `GET /api/v1/streams/{stream_id}`: Get stream status.
    *   `GET /api/v1/streams/{stream_id}/stats`: Get viewer stats.
