# Mass Live Streaming Service - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ Overview & Learning Objectives

The **Mass Live Streaming Service** is engineered to deliver high-quality, low-latency live video to millions of concurrent viewers, akin to platforms like Hotstar or YouTube Live. This service is a deep dive into high-performance media processing and large-scale content delivery.

### **Why this stack?**

*   **Go**: Chosen for its exceptional performance and concurrency features, which are critical for handling a massive number of simultaneous connections and processing video data in real-time.
*   **FFmpeg**: The swiss-army knife of media processing. We use it for real-time transcoding of video streams into multiple bitrates.
*   **Low-Latency HLS (LL-HLS)**: An extension to the HLS protocol that allows for near-real-time streaming with latencies of under 5 seconds, while still leveraging standard HTTP for delivery.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **Large-Scale Streaming Architecture**: Learn how to design and build a system that can handle millions of concurrent viewers.
*   **Real-time Video Processing**: Gain hands-on experience with FFmpeg for real-time video transcoding and segmentation.
*   **Low-Latency Streaming**: Implement LL-HLS to deliver a near-real-time viewing experience.
*   **CDN & Caching**: Learn how to use CDNs and consistent hashing to distribute content globally and efficiently.

## 2. ðŸš€ Implementation Plan (6 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Ingestion & Transcoding Setup**

*   **Goal**: Set up the basic infrastructure for ingesting and transcoding live video streams.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Project Setup**: Initialize a Go project and set up FFmpeg in a Docker environment.
    *   [ ] **RTMP Ingestion**: Create an RTMP server in Go to accept live streams from broadcasting software like OBS.

### **Week 2: Real-time Transcoding & Segmentation**

*   **Goal**: Transcode the incoming stream into multiple bitrates and segment it for HLS delivery.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **FFmpeg Transcoding**: Use Go to manage FFmpeg processes that transcode the incoming stream into multiple quality levels in real-time.
    *   [ ] **Segment Generation**: Configure FFmpeg to output video in small segments (e.g., 2 seconds) and store them in an object store like S3.

### **Week 3: LL-HLS Implementation**

*   **Goal**: Implement the LL-HLS protocol for low-latency streaming.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **HLS Manifest Generation**: Create a service to generate and continuously update the HLS master and media playlists.
    *   [ ] **LL-HLS Features**: Implement LL-HLS features like partial segments and blocking playlist reloads to reduce latency.

### **Week 4: CDN & Distribution**

*   **Goal**: Set up a multi-CDN architecture for global content delivery.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Multi-CDN Integration**: Integrate with multiple CDN providers.
    *   [ ] **Consistent Hashing**: Implement a consistent hashing algorithm to distribute segment requests across CDNs.

### **Week 5: Scalability & Redundancy**

*   **Goal**: Ensure the system is scalable and resilient.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Scalable Architecture**: Design the system to be horizontally scalable with load-balanced ingestion points.
    *   [ ] **Redundancy**: Implement redundant ingestion points and a failover mechanism for transcoding workers.

### **Week 6: Finalization**

*   **Goal**: Add monitoring and prepare for deployment.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Monitoring & Analytics**: Track viewer metrics and stream health.
    *   [ ] **Testing & Deployment**: Load test the system and deploy to production.

## 3. ðŸ”Œ API Design

-   **Ingestion**: RTMP endpoint (e.g., `rtmp://live.suuupra.com/app/{stream_key}`).
-   **Playback**: HLS manifest URL (e.g., `https://cdn.suuupra.com/live/{stream_id}/master.m3u8`).
-   **API**:
    -   `POST /api/v1/streams`: Create a new live stream, returns stream key.
    -   `GET /api/v1/streams/{stream_id}`: Get stream status.
    -   `GET /api/v1/streams/{stream_id}/stats`: Get viewer stats.
