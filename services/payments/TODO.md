This is the actionable, industry‑grade backlog mapping the Master PRD to engineering epics, milestones, and acceptance criteria. Timeboxes are indicative; sequence respects cross‑feature dependencies.

## Global KPIs & NFRs (apply to all epics)

- Success rate ≥ 99.9% p50 day, ≥ 99.5% p95 day
- Confirm→success latency p50 ≤ 300 ms; p95 ≤ 800 ms (online rails)
- Duplicate rate ≤ 1 in 10M money‑moving calls

- [ ] Device Linking & Session Handoff (surface + policy)
  - [ ] APIs: `/devices/link|revoke`, `/session/handoff`; passkey support; SMS number attest hooks
  - Acceptance: linking requires possession + biometric/passkey; unauthorized link ≈ 0

## Cross‑Feature Dependencies

- Ledger & Outbox before refunds/escrow/groups
- Risk before dynamic auth & MINI/MAX go‑live
- Alias & device linking before delegated pay
- Statement Builder depends on AA integrations & normalization

- Load: k6 scenarios for p50/p95 targets; soak tests 24h without drift or duplicates

## Observability Tasks

- Traces: intent → risk → route → rail → ledger, with correlation IDs
- Metrics: RED, rail health gauges, idempotency hit rates, challenge rates, alias adoption
- Alerts: High failure rate, duplicate suspicion, rail degradation, settlement slip

## Security & Privacy Tasks

- HSM/KMS integration for signing/secrets
- Field‑level encryption; tokenization of sensitive identifiers
- DEPA‑style consent artifacts for statements/AA; data minimization reviews
