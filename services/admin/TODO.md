# Admin Service - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. üéØ Overview & Learning Objectives

The **Admin Service** is the central nervous system for platform operations. It's a secure, internal-facing full-stack application that empowers administrators to manage users, moderate content, and monitor the health of the entire Suuupra ecosystem. This is not just a simple CRUD application; it's a mission-control center built with robust security and advanced backend concepts.

### **Why this stack?**

*   **Node.js/Express Backend**: Chosen for its strong ecosystem and performance in handling I/O-bound operations, which is typical for an admin panel that interacts with many other services.
*   **React Frontend**: Provides a modern, component-based architecture for building a complex and interactive user interface.
*   **PostgreSQL Database**: Its relational nature and support for JSONB fields offer a good balance of structured data for admin roles and flexible storage for audit logs.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **Full-Stack Development**: Gain experience in building both the frontend and backend of a complete application.
*   **Advanced Security**: Implement fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and verifiable audit trails.
*   **Complex Workflows**: Model and implement multi-step processes using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
*   **Data Integrity**: Learn how to use cryptographic techniques like Merkle trees to ensure the integrity of critical data like audit logs.

## 2. üöÄ Implementation Plan (4 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Foundation & User Management**

*   **Goal**: Establish the core application structure and build the foundational user management features.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Project Setup**: Initialize the Node.js/Express backend and the React frontend. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for a consistent development environment.
    *   [ ] **Schema Design**: Design the PostgreSQL schema for admins, roles, permissions, and the initial structure for audit logs.
    *   [ ] **User Management Backend**: Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on users (list, view, update status like ban/unban). Implement search and filtering.
    *   [ ] **RBAC Implementation**: Design and implement a robust RBAC system for different admin roles (e.g., `super-admin`, `content-moderator`).
    *   [ ] **User Management Frontend**: Build the React components for the user management section, including a user list, detail view, and status management controls.

### **Week 2: Content Moderation Workflow**

*   **Goal**: Build the tools for content moderators to review and manage user-generated content.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Moderation Schema**: Design the database schema for the content moderation queue and moderation decisions.
    *   [ ] **Moderation Backend**: Implement API endpoints to fetch content pending review and to submit moderation decisions (approve, reject, flag).
    *   [ ] **DAG for Moderation**: Implement the moderation process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This allows for complex workflows, such as `review -> escalate -> final_decision`.
    *   [ ] **Moderation Frontend**: Create the UI for the content moderation queue and a detailed review interface.
    *   [ ] **Verifiable Audit Trail**: Implement a Merkle Tree-based audit log for all admin actions. This creates a tamper-evident log of all changes.

### **Week 3: Platform Dashboard & Analytics**

*   **Goal**: Provide administrators with a high-level overview of the platform's health and key metrics.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Analytics Backend**: Create API endpoints to serve aggregated data for key platform metrics (e.g., new users, content submissions, revenue).
    *   [ ] **Dashboard Frontend**: Build a dashboard page using a charting library like Recharts or Chart.js to visualize the data.
    *   [ ] **System Health Monitoring**: Add a component to the dashboard that polls the `/health` endpoints of other microservices and displays their status.

### **Week 4: Security, Testing & Deployment**

*   **Goal**: Harden the service, ensure its reliability through testing, and prepare it for production.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Security Hardening**: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all admin accounts. Add strict input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
    *   [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for the backend, and component and end-to-end tests for the frontend.
    *   [ ] **Optimization**: Profile the application to identify and fix any performance bottlenecks.
    *   [ ] **Deployment**: Create production-ready build scripts and Kubernetes deployment manifests.

## 3. üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Admins and their roles
CREATE TABLE admins (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('super_admin', 'moderator', 'analyst')),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Content moderation queue
CREATE TABLE content_moderation_queue (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    content_id UUID NOT NULL,
    content_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'escalated')),
    submitted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    assigned_to UUID REFERENCES admins(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Tamper-evident audit log for admin actions
CREATE TABLE admin_audit_log (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    admin_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES admins(id),
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    target_entity VARCHAR(100),
    target_id VARCHAR(255),
    details JSONB, -- Details of the action
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    log_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, -- SHA-256 hash of the log entry
    previous_hash VARCHAR(64) -- Hash of the previous log entry, forming a chain
);
```

## 4. üîå API Design (REST)

-   `GET /api/admin/users`: List users with pagination and search.
-   `GET /api/admin/users/{id}`: Get user details.
-   `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/status`: Update user status (e.g., ban).
-   `GET /api/admin/moderation/queue`: Get content pending moderation.
-   `POST /api/admin/moderation/decide`: Make a moderation decision.
-   `GET /api/admin/dashboard/stats`: Get platform statistics.
-   `POST /api/admin/audit/verify`: Verify the integrity of the audit log chain.
