# UPI PSP Service - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ Overview & Learning Objectives

The **UPI PSP (Payment Service Provider) Service** is the user-facing component of the UPI clone. It provides the mobile application that users interact with to send and receive money. This service is a great opportunity to learn about building a secure, user-friendly, and feature-rich mobile application.

### **Why this stack?**

*   **Flutter**: A cross-platform UI toolkit that allows us to build a beautiful and performant mobile application for both Android and iOS from a single codebase.
*   **gRPC**: For its high-performance, low-latency, and strongly-typed communication with the UPI Core service.
*   **Secure Storage**: For securely storing user data, such as UPI PINs and transaction history, on the device.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **Mobile Application Development**: Learn how to build a cross-platform mobile application with Flutter.
*   **Secure Coding**: Implement security best practices for a financial application, such as secure storage, device binding, and root detection.
*   **User Experience (UX)**: Design and implement a user-friendly and intuitive user interface for a payment application.
*   **gRPC Integration**: Learn how to integrate a mobile application with a gRPC backend.

## 3. ðŸ”Œ API Design (gRPC)

The PSP service will primarily be a client of the UPI Core service. It will use the gRPC API defined in the UPI Core's `TODO.md` to process transactions and get transaction status.
