# Content Service - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. üéØ Overview & Learning Objectives

The **Content Service** is the heart of our platform's educational and media offerings. It manages the entire lifecycle of content, from creation and uploading to discovery and search. This service is a great opportunity to learn about handling large files, designing flexible data models, and building powerful search experiences.

### **Why this stack?**

*   **Node.js/Express**: A great choice for an I/O-bound service that deals with file uploads and database interactions.
*   **MongoDB**: Its flexible, document-based model is perfect for storing diverse content metadata that can evolve over time.
*   **Elasticsearch**: The industry standard for building powerful, scalable search engines. It provides advanced features like full-text search, aggregations, and relevance tuning.
*   **S3**: A scalable and durable object store for our media files.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **NoSQL Data Modeling**: Learn how to design flexible and efficient schemas in a document database like MongoDB.
*   **Search Engineering**: Gain hands-on experience with Elasticsearch, including indexing, querying, and ranking.
*   **Large File Uploads**: Implement a robust system for handling large file uploads using S3 multipart uploads.
*   **Content Management Systems**: Understand the principles of building a CMS, including versioning and approval workflows.

## 2. üöÄ Implementation Plan (4 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Foundation & File Uploads**

*   **Goal**: Set up the service and implement the core file upload functionality.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Project Setup**: Initialize the Node.js/Express project and set up the development environment with Docker.
    *   [ ] **MongoDB Schema Design**: Design the MongoDB schemas for content, categories, and tags.
    *   [ ] **S3 Multipart Upload**: Implement a resumable, chunked file upload system using S3 multipart uploads. This is essential for handling large video files.
    *   [ ] **Upload Progress Tracking**: Use WebSockets to provide real-time upload progress to the client.

### **Week 2: Content Management & Search Indexing**

*   **Goal**: Build the core content management features and integrate with Elasticsearch.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **CRUD Operations**: Implement API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting content metadata.
    *   [ ] **Elasticsearch Integration**: Set up an Elasticsearch index and create a pipeline to keep it in sync with MongoDB.
    *   [ ] **Custom Inverted Index**: As a learning exercise, implement a simple inverted index from scratch to understand the core concepts behind search engines.

### **Week 3: Content Approval & Versioning**

*   **Goal**: Implement a workflow for content approval and versioning.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Content Versioning**: Implement a system for versioning content, allowing creators to make changes without affecting the published version.
    *   [ ] **Approval Workflow**: Design and implement a content approval workflow, allowing moderators to review and approve new content and changes.

### **Week 4: Recommendations & Optimization**

*   **Goal**: Add content recommendation features and optimize the service for performance.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Content Similarity**: Implement algorithms to calculate the similarity between different pieces of content based on their metadata.
    *   [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Optimize search queries, add caching for frequently accessed content, and load test the file upload system.

## 3. üóÑÔ∏è Database & Search Index Schema

### **MongoDB Schema**:

```javascript
// Content Schema
const ContentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, index: 'text' },
  description: { type: String, index: 'text' },
  contentType: { type: String, enum: ['video', 'article', 'quiz'], required: true },
  // ... other fields
});

// Category Schema with hierarchical structure
const CategorySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  parent: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Category' }
});
```

### **Elasticsearch Index Mapping**:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": { "type": "text" },
      "description": { "type": "text" },
      "tags": { "type": "keyword" },
      "category": { "type": "keyword" },
      "embedding": { "type": "dense_vector", "dims": 768 }
    }
  }
}
```
