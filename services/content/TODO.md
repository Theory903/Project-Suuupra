## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> The Suuupra platform needs to manage a vast and diverse library of educational and media content. This content must be easily searchable, discoverable, and delivered to users in a reliable and performant manner. The challenge is to build a scalable and flexible content management system that can handle large file uploads, complex metadata, and powerful search and discovery features.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class content management system that empowers creators to share their knowledge and learners to discover it, providing a seamless and engaging content experience.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Content Management** | The system can create, read, update, and delete content and its metadata. | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| FR-2  | **Large File Uploads** | The system can handle large file uploads with resumability and progress tracking. | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| FR-3  | **Search & Discovery** | The system provides powerful search and discovery features, including full-text search and filtering. | ✅ **COMPLETE (Archived)** |
| FR-4  | **Content Approval & Versioning** | The system supports a content approval workflow and versioning of content. | ✅ **COMPLETE (Archived)** |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Scalability** | 1M+ content items | The system must be able to handle a large and growing library of content. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture with MongoDB and Elasticsearch. | ✅ **PARTIALLY ACHIEVED** |
| NFR-2 | **Performance** | <200ms search latency | Search and discovery must be fast and responsive. Challenge: Optimizing Elasticsearch queries and indexing. | 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** |
| NFR-3 | **Reliability** | 99.99% content availability | Content must be highly available to users. Challenge: Implementing a resilient storage and delivery system with S3 and a CDN. | ✅ **PARTIALLY ACHIEVED** |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Upload Failure:** What happens if a large file upload fails midway? (e.g., the system should allow the user to resume the upload from where it left off).
*   **Search Index Inconsistency:** How do we handle cases where the search index is out of sync with the database? (e.g., implement a reconciliation process to re-index the data).
*   **Invalid Content:** How do we handle cases where a user uploads invalid or malicious content? (e.g., implement a content validation and moderation process).

## 3. 🗺️ The Blueprint: Architecture & Design

### **3.1. System Architecture Diagram**

    A[Clients] --> B(Content Service);
    B --> C{MongoDB};
    B --> D[Elasticsearch];
    B --> E(S3);
```

### **3.2. Tech Stack Deep Dive**

| Component | Technology | Version | Justification & Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language/Framework** | `Node.js`, `Express` | `18.x`, `4.x` | Great for I/O-bound services that deal with file uploads and database interactions. |
| **Database** | `MongoDB` | `6.x` | Flexible, document-based model for storing diverse content metadata. |
| **Search** | `Elasticsearch` | `8.x` | Powerful, scalable search engine for advanced search features. |
| **Storage** | `AWS S3` | - | Scalable and durable object store for media files. |

### **3.3. Database Schema**

```javascript
// Content Schema
const ContentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, index: 'text' },
  description: { type: String, index: 'text' },
  contentType: { type: String, enum: ['video', 'article', 'quiz', 'document', 'course', 'lesson'], required: true },
  // ... other fields
});

// Category Schema with hierarchical structure
const CategorySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  parent: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Category' }
});
```

### **Elasticsearch Index Mapping**

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": { "type": "text" },
      "description": { "type": "text" },
      "tags": { "type": "keyword" },
      "category": { "type": "keyword" },
      "embedding": { "type": "dense_vector", "dims": 768 }
    }
  }
}
```
