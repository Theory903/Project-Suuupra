# UPI Core Service - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ Overview & Learning Objectives

The **UPI Core Service** is the central switch and orchestrator of the entire UPI clone ecosystem. It is responsible for routing transactions, ensuring security, and maintaining the integrity of the payment network. This service is a deep dive into building a high-performance, fault-tolerant, and secure financial transaction processing system.

### **Why this stack?**

*   **Go**: Chosen for its high performance, concurrency, and low-latency characteristics, which are essential for a real-time payment switch.
*   **gRPC**: For its high-performance, low-latency, and strongly-typed communication between internal services.
*   **Redis**: Used for caching routing information, transaction state, and for implementing distributed locking.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **High-Performance Networking**: Learn how to build a high-throughput, low-latency gRPC-based service.
*   **Distributed Systems**: Implement a fault-tolerant and scalable system with service discovery and load balancing.
*   **Financial Transaction Processing**: Understand the intricacies of routing, processing, and securing financial transactions.
*   **Cryptography**: Implement digital signatures and encryption to secure the payment network.

## 2. ðŸš€ Implementation Plan (4 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Foundation & Core Routing**

*   **Goal**: Set up the basic infrastructure and implement the core transaction routing logic.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Project Setup**: Initialize a Go project and set up gRPC, Redis, and a database.
    *   [ ] **Service Discovery**: Implement a service discovery mechanism (e.g., using Consul or etcd) for PSPs and banks.
    *   [ ] **Routing Engine**: Implement a routing engine that can route transactions based on the VPA.
    *   [ ] **Transaction State Machine**: Design and implement a state machine for the lifecycle of a UPI transaction.

### **Week 2: Security & Cryptography**

*   **Goal**: Implement the security layer of the UPI switch.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Digital Signatures**: Implement RSA-SHA256 digital signatures for all gRPC messages to ensure message integrity and non-repudiation.
    *   [ ] **Encryption**: Implement TLS with mutual authentication (mTLS) for all gRPC communication.
    *   [ ] **Key Management**: Implement a secure key management system for signing and encryption keys.

### **Week 3: Transaction Processing & Reconciliation**

*   **Goal**: Implement the core transaction processing and reconciliation logic.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Transaction Processing**: Implement the logic for processing different types of UPI transactions (e.g., P2P, P2M).
    *   [ ] **Reconciliation**: Implement a reconciliation process to ensure that all transactions are settled correctly between the banks.

### **Week 4: Monitoring, Testing & Deployment**

*   **Goal**: Add monitoring, write comprehensive tests, and prepare for deployment.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting**: Implement a monitoring system with Prometheus and Grafana to track the health and performance of the UPI switch.
    *   [ ] **Testing**: Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability of the service.
    *   [ ] **Deployment**: Dockerize the service and prepare it for deployment to Kubernetes.

## 3. ðŸ”Œ API Design (gRPC)

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package upi_core;

service UpiCore {
  rpc ProcessTransaction (TransactionRequest) returns (TransactionResponse);
  rpc GetTransactionStatus (TransactionStatusRequest) returns (TransactionStatusResponse);
}

message TransactionRequest {
  string transaction_id = 1;
  string payer_vpa = 2;
  string payee_vpa = 3;
  double amount = 4;
  string signature = 5;
}

message TransactionResponse {
  string transaction_id = 1;
  string status = 2;
  string error_message = 3;
}

message TransactionStatusRequest {
  string transaction_id = 1;
}

message TransactionStatusResponse {
  string transaction_id = 1;
  string status = 2;
}
```
