# **Service PRD: Gateway Service**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> As the Suuupra platform scales, managing the proliferation of microservices becomes a significant challenge. Clients need a single, unified entry point to the platform that is secure, reliable, and performant. The challenge is to build a gateway that can handle the complexities of a distributed system, including authentication, rate limiting, and service discovery, while providing a seamless experience for clients.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class API Gateway that serves as the front door to the Suuupra platform, providing a secure, reliable, and performant entry point for all client requests.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Authentication & Authorization** | The gateway must authenticate and authorize all incoming requests. |
| FR-2  | **Rate Limiting** | The gateway must protect downstream services from traffic spikes by implementing rate limiting. |
| FR-3  | **Request Routing** | The gateway must route requests to the appropriate downstream service based on the request path. |
| FR-4  | **Service Discovery** | The gateway must dynamically discover and route to healthy service instances. |
| FR-5  | **WebSocket Gateway** | The gateway must support real-time communication by proxying WebSocket connections. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Latency** | p99 < 150ms | The gateway should add minimal overhead to the request latency. Challenge: Optimizing the request pipeline and network calls. |
| NFR-2 | **Availability** | 99.99% | The gateway is a critical component and must be highly available. Challenge: Implementing a fault-tolerant and resilient architecture. |
| NFR-3 | **Scalability** | 50,000+ RPS | The gateway must be able to handle the traffic of the entire platform. Challenge: Designing a stateless and horizontally scalable architecture. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Downstream Service Unavailability:** How does the gateway handle failures in downstream services? (e.g., implement circuit breakers with fallbacks).
*   **Authentication Service Unavailability:** What happens if the identity service is down? (e.g., cache authentication decisions for a short period).
*   **Configuration Errors:** How do we prevent and handle misconfigurations in the routing rules? (e.g., implement a validation process for configuration changes).

    B --> E[Downstream Services];
```

### **3.2. Tech Stack Deep Dive**

| Component | Technology | Version | Justification & Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language/Framework** | `Node.js`, `Fastify` | `22+`, `4.x` | High-performance, low-overhead framework ideal for a gateway. |
| **Authentication** | `jsonwebtoken`, `@fastify/oauth2` | `9.x`, `4.x` | Standard libraries for JWT and OAuth2 implementation. |
| **Caching/Rate Limiting** | `Redis` | `7+` | In-memory data store for distributed rate limiting and caching. |
| **Service Discovery** | `Consul` or `Kubernetes DNS` | - | For dynamic service discovery and health checking. |

### **3.3. Database Schema**

The Gateway service is designed to be stateless and does not have its own persistent database. It relies on Redis for caching and downstream services for data persistence.

## 6. 🔭 The Observatory: Monitoring & Alerting

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
*   **Technical Metrics:** `Latency (p99, p95, p50)`, `Error Rate (5xx, 4xx)`, `Throughput (RPS)`.
