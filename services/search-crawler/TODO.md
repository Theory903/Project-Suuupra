## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> The Suuupra platform needs a powerful and scalable search engine to enable users to discover content across its vast and growing library. A simple database search is not sufficient to provide a good user experience. The challenge is to build a distributed web crawler and search engine that can index a massive amount of content, provide relevant and personalized search results, and scale to handle a high volume of queries.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class search engine that empowers users to discover the most relevant and engaging content on the Suuupra platform, providing a seamless and intuitive search experience.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Web Crawling** | The system can crawl and index a large volume of web content. |
| FR-2  | **Content Indexing** | The system can index content in a way that is optimized for search. |
| FR-3  | **Search & Ranking** | The system can provide relevant and personalized search results. |
| FR-4  | **Duplicate Detection** | The system can detect and handle duplicate content. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Scalability** | 100M+ documents | The system must be able to handle a large and growing volume of content. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture with a distributed crawler and Elasticsearch. |
| NFR-2 | **Performance** | <200ms search latency | Search must be fast and responsive. Challenge: Optimizing Elasticsearch queries and indexing. |
| NFR-3 | **Freshness** | <1 hour for high-priority content | The search index must be kept up-to-date. Challenge: Implementing an efficient and real-time indexing pipeline. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Crawler Traps:** How do we prevent the crawler from getting stuck in crawler traps (e.g., calendar pages that generate an infinite number of links)? (e.g., implement a depth limit and a URL blacklist).
*   **Politeness:** How do we ensure that the crawler is a good citizen of the web and does not overload websites? (e.g., respect `robots.txt` and implement a polite crawling policy).
*   **Search Relevance:** How do we handle cases where the search results are not relevant to the user's query? (e.g., use techniques like query expansion and learning-to-rank to improve relevance).
