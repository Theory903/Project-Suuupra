# **Service PRD: LLM Tutor Service**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> Traditional online learning often lacks the personalized guidance and immediate feedback that a human tutor can provide. The challenge is to build an AI-powered tutoring system that can understand a student's needs, provide personalized learning paths, and offer real-time assistance, all while ensuring the content is safe, accurate, and age-appropriate.

### **Mission**
> To build a revolutionary AI tutoring system that provides a personalized, engaging, and effective learning experience for every student on the Suuupra platform.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Conversational AI** | The system can engage in natural, multi-turn conversations with students. |
| FR-2  | **RAG & Knowledge Base** | The system can retrieve and use information from a vast knowledge base to answer student questions. |
| FR-3  | **Personalized Learning** | The system can adapt to each student's learning style and pace. |
| FR-4  | **Safety & Moderation** | The system can filter out harmful or inappropriate content. |
| FR-5  | **Adaptive Assessment** | The system can assess a student's knowledge and identify areas for improvement. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Response Latency** | <2s for 95th percentile | The system must provide real-time responses to keep students engaged. Challenge: Optimizing LLM inference and RAG retrieval. |
| NFR-2 | **Accuracy** | >90% for factual content | The system must provide accurate and reliable information. Challenge: Ensuring the quality of the knowledge base and the accuracy of the LLM's responses. |
| NFR-3 | **Safety** | <0.1% harmful content | The system must be safe for students of all ages. Challenge: Implementing robust safety filters and content moderation. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Hallucinations:** How do we handle cases where the LLM generates factually incorrect or nonsensical information? (e.g., use RAG to ground the LLM in factual knowledge and implement a fact-checking mechanism).
*   **Harmful Content:** How do we prevent the LLM from generating harmful or inappropriate content? (e.g., use a multi-layered safety filter and content moderation system).
*   **Student Disengagement:** What happens if a student becomes disengaged or frustrated? (e.g., the system should detect signs of disengagement and adapt its teaching strategy accordingly).

### **3.2. Tech Stack Deep Dive**

| Component | Technology | Version | Justification & Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LLM Serving** | `vLLM` | - | A high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. |
| **Backend** | `Python`, `FastAPI` | `3.11`, `0.104` | High-performance, async framework ideal for ML-powered services. |
| **Vector Database** | `ChromaDB` or `Pinecone` | - | For efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. |
| **Memory Store** | `Redis` | `7+` | For caching and session management. |

### **3.3. Key Components**

*   **RAG Pipeline:** Responsible for retrieving relevant context from the knowledge base to ground the LLM.
*   **Memory Systems:** Responsible for managing the conversation history and personalizing the learning experience.
*   **Safety Filters:** Responsible for filtering out harmful or inappropriate content.
