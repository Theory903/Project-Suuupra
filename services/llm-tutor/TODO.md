## 1. Vision & Strategy

### 1.1. Mission
To deliver a safe, adaptive, and highly engaging multimodal AI tutor that leverages open-weight GPT-OSS models, advanced RAG techniques, and a state-of-the-art voice interface to provide a personalized and effective learning experience.

### 1.2. Problem Statement
Traditional online learning platforms lack the immediate, personalized feedback crucial for effective learning. This service will bridge that gap with an AI that acts as a dedicated, one-on-one tutor, adapting to each student's pace and identifying knowledge gaps.

### 1.3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **User Engagement:** Daily Active Users (DAU), Session Duration, Interactions per Session.
- **Learning Efficacy:** Mastery Velocity, Quiz/Assessment Scores, Hint Efficiency.
- **System Performance:** p95 Latency, Uptime (SLA), Cost per User.
- **Safety & Trust:** Harmful Content Block Rate, Citation Accuracy, User Trust Score.

## 2. Architecture & Design

### 2.1. System Architecture
The architecture is designed for scalability, modularity, and low latency, with a clear separation of concerns between orchestration, AI/ML inference, and state management.

| **Prompt Injection** | Strict input validation, structured prompt formats (e.g., Harmony), instruction-tuned models, output parsing. |
| **PII Leakage**      | PII detection and masking on both input and retrieved context before sending to the LLM.                        |
| **Harmful Content**  | Multi-layered approach: input/output classifiers (e.g., Llama Guard), deterministic refusal flows, audit logging. |
| **Denial of Service**  | Rate limiting at the API Gateway, cost-based limiting on query complexity, robust auto-scaling.                   |

### 6.2. Compliance & Data Privacy
- **Data Subject Rights (DSR):** Implement automated pipelines for data export and deletion requests.
- **Consent Management:** Explicit, logged consent for any PII storage and for voice cloning features.
- **Data Retention:** Enforce strict TTLs on conversational history and other sensitive data.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Use Trivy/Snyk in the CI pipeline to scan for vulnerabilities in container images and libraries.
