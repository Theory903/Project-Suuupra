# Analytics Service - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. üéØ Overview & Learning Objectives

The **Analytics Service** is the data brain of the Suuupra platform. It's responsible for ingesting, processing, and analyzing high-volume event streams in real-time to provide valuable insights for business intelligence, product development, and personalization.

### **Why this stack?**

*   **Kafka**: A distributed event streaming platform that can handle high-throughput, real-time data feeds. It acts as a durable, scalable buffer for our event data.
*   **Apache Flink**: A powerful stream-processing framework that allows us to perform complex, stateful computations on unbounded event streams.
*   **ClickHouse**: A columnar database designed for high-performance OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries. It's perfect for a data warehouse.
*   **Python/FastAPI**: For creating a high-performance API layer to expose the analytical data to dashboards and other services.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **Real-time Data Pipelines**: Build an end-to-end stream processing pipeline from ingestion to analytics.
*   **Stateful Stream Processing**: Learn how to manage state in a distributed streaming application with Flink.
*   **Big Data Technologies**: Gain hands-on experience with Kafka, Flink, and ClickHouse.
*   **Approximate Algorithms**: Understand and implement probabilistic data structures like HyperLogLog for efficient cardinality estimation.

## 2. üöÄ Implementation Plan (6 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Infrastructure & Event Ingestion**

*   **Goal**: Set up the data pipeline infrastructure and start ingesting events.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Infrastructure Setup**: Provision Kafka, Flink, and ClickHouse clusters using Docker or Kubernetes.
    *   [ ] **Event Schema Definition**: Define the schemas for our events using a schema registry like Avro or Protobuf. This ensures data quality and compatibility.
    *   [ ] **Event Ingestion**: Create a Kafka producer in our services to send events to Kafka topics. Alternatively, use Kafka Connect to pull data from our databases.

### **Week 2: Real-time Aggregations with Flink**

*   **Goal**: Implement Flink jobs to perform real-time aggregations on the event data.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Core Metrics Job**: Create a Flink job to calculate real-time metrics like user activity (views, active users) using tumbling windows.
    *   [ ] **HyperLogLog for Cardinality**: Use Flink's built-in HyperLogLog functions to efficiently estimate the number of unique users.
    *   [ ] **ClickHouse Sink**: Create a Flink sink to write the aggregated data to ClickHouse.

### **Week 3: Content & Commerce Analytics**

*   **Goal**: Build analytics specific to content engagement and commerce.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Engagement Metrics**: Create a Flink job to calculate content engagement scores (e.g., watch time, completion rate).
    *   [ ] **Conversion Funnels**: Track user funnels (e.g., view -> add to cart -> purchase).
    *   [ ] **Revenue Analytics**: Process commerce events to calculate real-time revenue metrics.

### **Week 4: Dashboarding & BI**

*   **Goal**: Visualize the analytical data.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **ClickHouse Optimization**: Create materialized views in ClickHouse to pre-aggregate data for fast dashboard queries.
    *   [ ] **Analytics API**: Build a FastAPI service to query ClickHouse and expose the data to the frontend.
    *   [ ] **Dashboarding**: Use a tool like Grafana or build a custom React frontend to create interactive dashboards.

### **Week 5: Advanced Analytics**

*   **Goal**: Implement more advanced analytical features.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **A/B Testing Framework**: Implement a Flink job to analyze A/B test results in real-time and calculate statistical significance.
    *   [ ] **User Segmentation**: Create a Flink job to segment users based on their behavior (e.g., power users, churn risks).

### **Week 6: Optimization & Deployment**

*   **Goal**: Prepare the analytics pipeline for production.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Performance Tuning**: Optimize Flink job parallelism, state backends, and checkpointing. Tune ClickHouse schema and queries.
    *   [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting**: Set up monitoring for the entire pipeline (Kafka, Flink, ClickHouse) and create alerts for potential issues.
    *   [ ] **Deployment**: Deploy the pipeline to a production Kubernetes environment.

```sql
-- Raw events table
CREATE TABLE view_events (
    user_id UUID,
    content_id UUID,
    timestamp DateTime,
    watch_time_seconds UInt32

PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(timestamp)
ORDER BY (user_id, content_id, timestamp);

-- Aggregated metrics table
CREATE TABLE real_time_metrics (
    timestamp DateTime,
    metric_name String,
    metric_value Float64,
    dimensions Map(String, String)
) ENGINE = SummingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (metric_name, timestamp, dimensions);

-- Materialized View for hourly unique users
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW unique_users_hourly_mv
TO unique_users_hourly
AS SELECT
    toStartOfHour(timestamp) AS hour,
    uniqState(user_id) AS unique_users_state

GROUP BY hour;

CREATE TABLE unique_users_hourly (
    hour DateTime,
    unique_users AggregateFunction(uniq, UUID)
) ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
ORDER BY hour;
```
