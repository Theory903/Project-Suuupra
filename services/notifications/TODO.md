# **Service PRD: Notifications Service**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> The Suuupra platform needs to communicate with its users in a timely, reliable, and personalized manner across multiple channels. A simple, unmanaged notification system will lead to a poor user experience, with missed notifications, spam, and a lack of personalization. The challenge is to build a centralized, multi-channel notification service that can handle millions of notifications per day, with guaranteed delivery, priority queuing, and a powerful template engine.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class notification service that enables the Suuupra platform to communicate with its users in a timely, reliable, and personalized manner, fostering user engagement and trust.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Multi-channel Delivery** | The system can send notifications via push, email, SMS, and WebSocket. |
| FR-2  | **Priority Queues** | The system can prioritize notifications based on their importance. |
| FR-3  | **Template Engine** | The system can use templates to generate personalized and multi-language notifications. |
| FR-4  | **Delivery Guarantees** | The system provides at-least-once delivery guarantees with retry mechanisms. |
| FR-5  | **User Preferences** | The system allows users to manage their notification preferences. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Scalability** | 1M+ notifications/day | The system must be able to handle a high volume of notifications. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture with Celery and Redis. |
| NFR-2 | **Reliability** | 99.9% delivery success | Notifications must be delivered reliably. Challenge: Implementing a robust delivery engine with retries and dead letter queues. |
| NFR-3 | **Performance** | <50ms template rendering | Template rendering must be fast to avoid delays in notification delivery. Challenge: Optimizing the template engine and caching. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Provider Failure:** What happens if a channel provider (e.g., FCM, SES) is down? (e.g., the system should retry with exponential backoff and, if necessary, failover to another provider or channel).
*   **Invalid Recipient:** How do we handle cases where a recipient's address (e.g., email, phone number) is invalid? (e.g., the system should mark the recipient as invalid and stop sending notifications to them).
*   **Throttling:** How do we handle rate limiting from channel providers? (e.g., the system should respect the provider's rate limits and backoff when necessary).

### **3.2. Tech Stack Deep Dive**

| Component | Technology | Version | Justification & Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language/Framework** | `Python`, `Django` | `3.11+`, `4.2` | A mature and robust ecosystem for building web services and managing complex business logic. |
| **Async Tasks** | `Celery` | `5.x` | A powerful and flexible framework for running asynchronous tasks. |
| **Message Queue** | `Redis` | `7+` | A high-performance, in-memory data store for message queuing and caching. |
| **Database** | `PostgreSQL` | `15` | A reliable relational database for storing notification data and user preferences. |

### **3.3. Database Schema**

```sql
-- Notification templates with multi-channel support
CREATE TABLE notification_templates (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    path VARCHAR(200) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    push_template TEXT,
    email_subject_template VARCHAR(200),
    email_body_template TEXT,
    sms_template VARCHAR(160),
    websocket_template TEXT,
    supported_channels TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    required_variables JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Notification messages
CREATE TABLE notification_messages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    template_id UUID REFERENCES notification_templates(id),
    channel VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 3,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    scheduled_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    sent_at TIMESTAMP,
    delivered_at TIMESTAMP,
    read_at TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
