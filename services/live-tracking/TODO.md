# Live Tracking Service - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. üéØ Overview & Learning Objectives

The **Live Tracking Service** is a high-performance system for real-time GPS tracking, ETA calculation, and route optimization. This service is a fascinating blend of real-time data processing, geospatial databases, and high-performance computing.

### **Why this stack?**

*   **Go**: An excellent choice for the main service due to its high concurrency and performance for network services.
*   **Rust**: Used for a specific, CPU-intensive task: route optimization. Rust provides the performance of C++ with memory safety, making it ideal for a critical library like our pathfinding engine.
*   **PostGIS**: A PostgreSQL extension that adds support for geographic objects, allowing for efficient spatial queries.
*   **Redis**: Used for caching the last known location of tracked entities for low-latency lookups.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **Geospatial Systems**: Learn how to build a real-time application that deals with geospatial data.
*   **Polyglot Programming**: Gain experience in building a service with two different languages (Go and Rust), and learn how to make them interoperate.
*   **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implement the A* algorithm, a classic and widely used pathfinding algorithm.
*   **Spatial Indexing**: Learn about Geohashing and how it can be used for efficient nearby searches.

## 2. üöÄ Implementation Plan (5 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Foundation & GPS Ingestion**

*   **Goal**: Set up the core infrastructure and the data ingestion pipeline for GPS data.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Project Setup**: Initialize the Go project for the main service and the Rust project for the pathfinding library. Set up PostGIS and Redis.
    *   [ ] **GPS Data Ingestion**: Create a WebSocket or UDP endpoint in Go to receive GPS coordinates from devices. Store the latest location in Redis and the location history in PostGIS.

### **Week 2: Real-time Tracking & Geofencing**

*   **Goal**: Build the core real-time tracking and geofencing features.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Real-time Tracking API**: Implement an API endpoint to get the real-time location of a tracked entity. Use WebSockets to push location updates to clients.
    *   [ ] **Geofencing**: Implement an API to create, update, and delete geofences (polygons stored in PostGIS). Create a system to trigger events when a tracked entity enters or exits a geofence.

### **Week 3: Routing & ETA Calculation**

*   **Goal**: Implement route optimization and ETA calculation.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Route Optimization (Rust)**: Load map data (e.g., from OpenStreetMap) into a graph. Implement the A* pathfinding algorithm in Rust and expose it as a C-compatible library.
    *   [ ] **ETA Calculation (Go)**: Create an API endpoint to calculate the ETA between two points. This will involve calling the Rust pathfinding library to get the optimal route.

### **Week 4: Geospatial Indexing & k-NN**

*   **Goal**: Implement efficient geospatial search.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **k-NN Search**: Implement a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) search to find the closest entities to a given point, using PostGIS's spatial indexes.
    *   [ ] **Geohashing**: Implement Geohashing to create a grid-based index of locations. Store Geohashes in Redis for low-latency nearby searches.

### **Week 5: Finalization**

*   **Goal**: Integrate all components, test thoroughly, and prepare for deployment.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Integration & Testing**: Integrate the Go service with the Rust library. Write comprehensive unit, integration, and load tests.
    *   [ ] **Deployment**: Dockerize the service and prepare it for deployment to Kubernetes.

## 3. üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (PostGIS)

```sql
-- Enable PostGIS extension
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

-- Table for tracked entities
CREATE TABLE tracked_entities (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL -- e.g., 'delivery_driver', 'bus'
);

-- Table for location history
CREATE TABLE location_history (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tracked_entities(id),
    coordinates GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL, -- Store as geography for real-world distance calculations
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Spatial index for efficient location queries
CREATE INDEX location_history_coordinates_idx ON location_history USING GIST (coordinates);

-- Table for geofences
CREATE TABLE geofences (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    area GEOGRAPHY(POLYGON, 4326) NOT NULL
);

-- Spatial index for efficient geofence queries
CREATE INDEX geofences_area_idx ON geofences USING GIST (area);
```
