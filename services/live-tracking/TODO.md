# **Service PRD: Live Tracking Service**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> The Suuupra platform needs to provide real-time tracking of its mobile entities, such as delivery drivers and buses. This requires a high-performance system that can ingest a massive volume of GPS data, process it in real-time, and provide accurate location updates and ETA calculations. The challenge is to build a system that is not only scalable and reliable but also provides advanced features like geofencing and route optimization.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class live tracking system that provides real-time visibility into the location and movement of all mobile entities on the Suuupra platform, enabling us to optimize our operations and provide a better experience for our users.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Real-time Tracking** | The system can ingest and process real-time GPS data from mobile devices. |
| FR-2  | **Geofencing** | The system can create, manage, and trigger events based on geofences. |
| FR-3  | **Route Optimization** | The system can calculate the optimal route between two points. |
| FR-4  | **ETA Calculation** | The system can calculate the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for a given route. |
| FR-5  | **k-NN Search** | The system can find the k-nearest neighbors to a given point. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Latency** | <100ms for location updates | Real-time tracking requires low-latency location updates. Challenge: Optimizing the data ingestion and processing pipeline. |
| NFR-2 | **Scalability** | 1M+ tracked entities | The system must be able to handle a large and growing number of tracked entities. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture with Go and Rust. |
| NFR-3 | **Accuracy** | <10m for location | The system must provide accurate location data. Challenge: Handling GPS inaccuracies and signal loss. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **GPS Signal Loss:** How does the system handle cases where a device loses its GPS signal? (e.g., use a combination of cellular and Wi-Fi triangulation to estimate the location).
*   **Map Data Inaccuracy:** What happens if the map data is inaccurate? (e.g., provide a mechanism for users to report map errors).
*   **Route Recalculation:** How does the system handle cases where a driver deviates from the optimal route? (e.g., automatically recalculate the route and update the ETA).

### **3.2. Tech Stack Deep Dive**

| Component | Technology | Version | Justification & Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language/Framework** | `Go`, `Rust` | `1.21`, `1.72` | Go for the main service and Rust for the CPU-intensive pathfinding library. |
| **Database** | `PostGIS`, `Redis` | `15`, `7+` | PostGIS for geospatial queries and Redis for caching last known locations. |

### **3.3. Database Schema**

```sql
-- Enable PostGIS extension
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

-- Table for tracked entities
CREATE TABLE tracked_entities (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL -- e.g., 'delivery_driver', 'bus'
);

-- Table for location history
CREATE TABLE location_history (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tracked_entities(id),
    coordinates GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Spatial index for efficient location queries
CREATE INDEX location_history_coordinates_idx ON location_history USING GIST (coordinates);

-- Table for geofences
CREATE TABLE geofences (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    area GEOGRAPHY(POLYGON, 4326) NOT NULL
);

-- Spatial index for efficient geofence queries
CREATE INDEX geofences_area_idx ON geofences USING GIST (area);
```
