# **Service PRD: Recommendation Engine**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> The Suuupra platform has a vast and growing library of content, but users struggle to discover content that is relevant to their interests and learning goals. A generic, one-size-fits-all approach to content discovery will lead to a poor user experience and low engagement. The challenge is to build a sophisticated recommendation engine that can provide personalized and relevant content recommendations to each user, based on their unique preferences and behavior.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class recommendation engine that empowers users to discover the most relevant and engaging content on the Suuupra platform, fostering a love of learning and driving user engagement.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Personalized Recommendations** | The system can provide personalized content recommendations to each user. |
| FR-2  | **Collaborative Filtering** | The system can recommend content based on the behavior of similar users. |
| FR-3  | **Content-Based Filtering** | The system can recommend content based on its similarity to content that a user has previously interacted with. |
| FR-4  | **Real-time Personalization** | The system can update recommendations in real-time based on a user's most recent interactions. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Relevance** | High | Recommendations must be relevant to the user's interests. Challenge: Designing and tuning the recommendation algorithms. |
| NFR-2 | **Scalability** | 1M+ users, 100K+ items | The system must be able to handle a large and growing number of users and content items. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture with Neo4j and Faiss. |
| NFR-3 | **Performance** | <100ms for recommendations | Recommendations must be generated quickly to provide a good user experience. Challenge: Optimizing the recommendation algorithms and infrastructure. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Cold Start:** How do we provide recommendations to new users who have no interaction history? (e.g., use content-based filtering and popular items to provide initial recommendations).
*   **Data Sparsity:** How do we handle cases where we have very little data for a user or item? (e.g., use a hybrid approach that combines collaborative and content-based filtering).
*   **Popularity Bias:** How do we prevent the recommendation engine from only recommending popular items? (e.g., use techniques like diversification and exploration to expose users to a wider range of content).
