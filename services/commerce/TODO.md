# **Service PRD: Commerce Service**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> As the Suuupra platform grows, managing orders and ensuring data consistency across multiple services becomes a significant challenge. A simple monolithic approach to order management will not scale and will lead to a tightly coupled and brittle system. The challenge is to build a highly available, scalable, and resilient order management system that can handle complex, multi-service order fulfillment while maintaining data consistency.

### **Mission**
> To build a sophisticated order management system that serves as the backbone of all monetization on the Suuupra platform, enabling seamless and reliable e-commerce experiences.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Order Management** | The system can create, read, update, and delete orders. |
| FR-2  | **Shopping Cart** | The system provides a persistent shopping cart for users. |
| FR-3  | **Inventory Management** | The system manages inventory for all products. |
| FR-4  | **Distributed Transactions** | The system can manage long-running, distributed transactions that span multiple microservices. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Data Consistency** | 100% | The system must maintain data consistency across all services. Challenge: Implementing the Saga pattern for distributed transactions. |
| NFR-2 | **Scalability** | 1000 orders/sec | The system must be able to handle a high volume of orders. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture with CQRS and Event Sourcing. |
| NFR-3 | **Availability** | 99.99% | The order management system is a critical component and must be highly available. Challenge: Implementing a fault-tolerant and resilient architecture. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Payment Failure:** What happens if the payment for an order fails? (e.g., the Saga should trigger a compensating transaction to release the inventory).
*   **Inventory Unavailability:** What happens if an item is out of stock when a user tries to place an order? (e.g., the system should prevent the order from being placed and notify the user).
*   **Concurrent Updates:** How do we handle cases where multiple users try to purchase the last item in stock simultaneously? (e.g., use optimistic locking to prevent race conditions).

### **3.2. Tech Stack Deep Dive**

| Component | Technology | Version | Justification & Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language/Framework** | `Python`, `FastAPI` | `3.11`, `0.104` | High-performance, async framework ideal for I/O-bound services. |
| **Database** | `PostgreSQL`, `Redis` | `15`, `7+` | PostgreSQL for ACID transactions and Redis for caching and shopping carts. |

### **3.3. Database Schema**

```sql
-- Event Store for Event Sourcing
CREATE TABLE events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
    aggregate_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(aggregate_id, version)
);

-- Read model for orders
CREATE TABLE order_views (
    order_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Saga state persistence
CREATE TABLE saga_instances (
    saga_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    saga_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    correlation_id UUID NOT NULL,
    current_step INTEGER NOT NULL,
    saga_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

## 4. 🚀 The Quest: Implementation Plan & Milestones

### **Phase 1: CQRS & Event Sourcing Foundation (Week 1)**

*   **Objective:** Lay the foundation for the service with CQRS and Event Sourcing.
*   **Key Results:**
    *   The service can store and replay events.
    *   The `Order` aggregate is implemented.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **CQRS Setup**: Design the separation between command and query models.
    *   [ ] **Event Sourcing**: Design the event store schema and implement the `Aggregate` base class.
    *   [ ] **Order Aggregate**: Implement the `Order` aggregate with its business logic and events.

### **Phase 2: Saga Pattern & State Machines (Week 2)**

*   **Objective:** Implement the order fulfillment process using sagas and state machines.
*   **Key Results:**
    *   The order fulfillment saga is implemented and can orchestrate other services.
