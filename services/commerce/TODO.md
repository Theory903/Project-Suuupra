# **Service PRD: Commerce Service**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**

> As the Suuupra platform grows, managing orders and ensuring data consistency across multiple services becomes a significant challenge. A simple monolithic approach to order management will not scale and will lead to a tightly coupled and brittle system. The challenge is to build a highly available, scalable, and resilient order management system that can handle complex, multi-service order fulfillment while maintaining data consistency.

### **Mission**

> To build a sophisticated order management system that serves as the backbone of all monetization on the Suuupra platform, enabling seamless and reliable e-commerce experiences.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature                 | Description | Status |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|--------|
| FR-1  | **Order Management**    | The system can create, read, update, and delete orders. | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| FR-2  | **Shopping Cart**       | The system provides a persistent shopping cart for users. | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| FR-3  | **Inventory Management**| The system manages inventory for all products. | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| FR-4  | **Distributed Transactions** | The system can manage long-running, distributed transactions that span multiple microservices. | ✅ **COMPLETE** |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement       | Target          | Status | Implementation Notes |
|--------|------------------|----------------|--------|----------------------|
| NFR-1  | **Data Consistency** | 100%            | ✅ **ACHIEVED** | Event Sourcing + CQRS with proper event handlers |
| NFR-2  | **Scalability**      | 1000 orders/sec | 🚧 **READY** | Architecture supports horizontal scaling |
| NFR-3  | **Availability**     | 99.99%          | 🚧 **READY** | Fault-tolerant design with compensating transactions |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

- ✅ **Payment Failure:** Saga triggers compensating transactions to release inventory
- ✅ **Inventory Unavailability:** System prevents orders and notifies users  
- ✅ **Concurrent Updates:** Optimistic locking prevents race conditions
- ✅ **Event Replay:** Proper event sourcing ensures state consistency
