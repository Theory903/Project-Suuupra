- **Aggregation**: Real-time and batch aggregation capabilities
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Isolated counters per tenant with namespace support

### âœ… **Production Infrastructure**
- **Go Application**: High-performance concurrent backend
- **Redis Cluster**: Distributed storage with automatic sharding
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL for persistence and historical data
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and structured logging
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive readiness and liveness probes

### âœ… **Enterprise Features**
- **Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, access control
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with consistent hashing
- **Reliability**: Data consistency, conflict resolution, automatic recovery
- **Observability**: Distributed tracing, performance metrics, error tracking
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage

### âœ… **Performance Targets**
- **Latency**: <50ms response time for counter operations
- **Throughput**: 100k operations/s sustained load

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> The Suuupra platform needs to track millions of metrics in real-time (views, likes, shares, downloads, etc.) with high accuracy and low latency. Traditional database-based counters cannot handle this scale and would become a bottleneck.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class distributed counter service that provides real-time, accurate, and scalable metrics tracking for the entire platform.
