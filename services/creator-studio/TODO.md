# Creator Studio - Comprehensive TODO

## 1. üéØ Overview & Learning Objectives

**Creator Studio** is the command center for our content creators. It's a feature-rich, full-stack application that provides all the tools creators need to upload, manage, analyze, and monetize their content. This is a great project for learning how to build a user-facing application with a rich feature set.

### **Why this stack?**

*   **Node.js Backend**: A solid choice for a service that orchestrates other services (like the VOD service) and handles a lot of I/O.
*   **React Frontend**: A powerful and popular library for building modern, interactive user interfaces.
*   **MongoDB**: Its flexible schema is well-suited for storing content metadata and analytics data, which can vary and evolve.

### **Learning Focus**:

*   **Full-Stack Development**: Build a complete, end-to-end application from the database to the UI.
*   **Large File Uploads**: Implement a system for handling large file uploads with S3 multipart uploads.
*   **Data Visualization**: Design and build an analytics dashboard with charts and graphs.
*   **High-Throughput Analytics**: Learn how to use techniques like sharded counters and Min-Heaps to build a scalable analytics backend.

## 2. üöÄ Implementation Plan (5 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Foundation & Content Upload**

*   **Goal**: Set up the project and implement the core content upload functionality.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Project Setup**: Initialize the Node.js backend and React frontend projects, and set up a Docker-compose development environment.
    *   [ ] **Schema Design**: Design the MongoDB schemas for content, analytics, and creator data.
    *   [ ] **S3 Multipart Upload**: Implement a resumable, chunked file upload system on the backend using S3 multipart uploads.
    *   [ ] **React Upload Component**: Create a file upload component in React that provides real-time progress feedback.

### **Week 2: Content Management**

*   **Goal**: Build the tools for creators to manage their content.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Content Management Backend**: Implement API endpoints to list, edit, and delete content.
    *   [ ] **Content Management Frontend**: Create a content dashboard where creators can view and manage all their content.

### **Week 3: Analytics Dashboard**

*   **Goal**: Build a dashboard to provide creators with insights into their content's performance.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Analytics Backend**: Implement API endpoints to serve analytics data. Use sharded counters for high-throughput view counts and a Min-Heap to efficiently calculate the Top-K performing videos.
    *   [ ] **Analytics Frontend**: Build an analytics dashboard with charts and graphs to visualize the data.

### **Week 4: Monetization**

*   **Goal**: Implement features that allow creators to earn money from their content.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Monetization Backend**: Integrate with a payment service to handle creator payouts. Implement the logic for calculating revenue.
    *   [ ] **Monetization Frontend**: Create a UI for creators to set up their payment information and a dashboard to track their earnings.

### **Week 5: Finalization**

*   **Goal**: Add final touches and prepare for deployment.

*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **User Feedback**: Implement a system for creators to view and respond to comments.
    *   [ ] **Testing & Deployment**: Write comprehensive tests and prepare the service for production.
