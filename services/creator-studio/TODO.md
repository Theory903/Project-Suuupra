# **Service PRD: Creator Studio**

## 1. 🎯 The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> Content creators are the lifeblood of the Suuupra platform, but they lack a centralized and powerful tool to manage their content, analyze its performance, and monetize their work. The challenge is to build a feature-rich, user-friendly Creator Studio that empowers creators to manage their content lifecycle, understand their audience, and build a sustainable career on the platform.

### **Mission**
> To build a world-class Creator Studio that provides our creators with the tools, insights, and monetization opportunities they need to succeed.

## 2. 🧠 The Gauntlet: Core Requirements & Edge Cases

### **Core Functional Requirements (FRs)**

| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1  | **Content Management** | Creators can upload, manage, and edit their content. |
| FR-2  | **Analytics Dashboard** | Creators can view detailed analytics about their content's performance. |
| FR-3  | **Monetization** | Creators can monetize their content and track their earnings. |
| FR-4  | **User Feedback** | Creators can view and respond to comments on their content. |

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target | Justification & Key Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | **Usability** | High | The Creator Studio must be intuitive and easy to use for creators of all technical skill levels. Challenge: Designing a user-friendly UI/UX. |
| NFR-2 | **Performance** | <500ms page load | The Creator Studio must be fast and responsive. Challenge: Optimizing the performance of the frontend and backend. |
| NFR-3 | **Scalability** | 1M+ creators | The Creator Studio must be able to handle a large and growing number of creators. Challenge: Designing a scalable architecture. |

### **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios**

*   **Upload Failure:** What happens if a large file upload fails midway? (e.g., the system should allow the creator to resume the upload from where it left off).
*   **Analytics Lag:** What happens if there is a lag in the analytics data? (e.g., the system should display a message indicating that the data is not yet up-to-date).
*   **Payment Failure:** What happens if a creator's payout fails? (e.g., the system should notify the creator and provide instructions on how to resolve the issue).

    C --> D{MongoDB};
    C --> E(VOD Service);
    C --> F(Analytics Service);
    C --> G(Payment Service);
```

### **3.2. Tech Stack Deep Dive**

| Component | Technology | Version | Justification & Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language/Framework** | `Node.js`, `React` | `18.x`, `18.x` | A solid choice for a full-stack application with a rich UI. |
| **Database** | `MongoDB` | `6.x` | Flexible schema for storing content metadata and analytics data. |

### **3.3. Database Schema**

```javascript
// Content Schema
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  creatorId: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  tags: [String],
  status: 'processing' | 'private' | 'public',
  uploadDate: Date,
  s3_key: String,
  transcoding_status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  duration: Number, // in seconds
  thumbnail_url: String
}

// Analytics Schema (per video)
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  contentId: ObjectId,
  daily_stats: [
    {
      date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
      views: Number,
      watch_time: Number, // in minutes
      likes: Number
    }
  ],
  demographics: {
    age: { '18-24': Number, '25-34': Number },
    gender: { 'male': Number, 'female': Number }
  }
}
```
