# **Service PRD: API Gateway**

## 1. üéØ The Challenge: Problem Statement & Mission

### **Problem Statement**
> As the number of microservices in the Suuupra platform grows, clients (web, mobile) face increasing complexity in consuming them. Each service has its own endpoint, authentication mechanism, and rate-limiting policy. This creates a tight coupling between clients and services, making the system brittle and difficult to evolve. The challenge is to build a unified entry point that decouples clients from services, providing a consistent and secure API for all consumers, while handling the complexities of a distributed system.

### **Mission**
> Provide a robust, secure, and highly performant API Gateway that acts as the single entry point for all client requests, simplifying client-side development and enabling seamless evolution of the microservices architecture.

## 2. üß† Core Requirements (FR/NFR) & Edge Cases

### Functional Requirements (FRs)
| FR-ID | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Request Routing | Route incoming requests to the appropriate downstream service based on the request path. |
| FR-2 | Authentication & Authorization | Authenticate and authorize incoming requests (JWT/JWKS, API Keys, scopes). |
| FR-3 | Rate Limiting | Protect downstream services via distributed rate limiting. |
| FR-4 | Service Discovery | Dynamically discover and route to healthy service instances. |
| FR-5 | WebSocket Proxying | Support real-time communication (rooms, heartbeats, auth). |

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
| NFR-ID | Requirement | Target |
|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | Latency | p99 < 150ms gateway overhead |
| NFR-2 | Availability | 99.99% |
| NFR-3 | Scalability | 50,000+ RPS horizontally |

### Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios
- Downstream service unavailability ‚Üí circuit breakers, fallbacks
- Identity provider/JWKS outages ‚Üí cache, error handling
- Configuration errors ‚Üí validation, atomic hot reload

## 3. üó∫Ô∏è Architecture (High-Level)
- Fastify-based HTTP server with config-driven pipeline
- Per-route policies for auth, limits, retries, breakers, AI, security
- Discovery providers + load balancer with health/outlier detection
- Admin API with audit log and hot reload
- Observability via Prometheus and OpenTelemetry
