# Incident Response

## Overview

Comprehensive incident response procedures for handling production issues, outages, and security incidents.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Examples | Response Time |
|----------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Complete service outage or security breach | API Gateway down, payment processing failed, data breach | 15 minutes |
| **P1 - High** | Major functionality impacted | Single service down, significant performance degradation | 1 hour |
| **P2 - Medium** | Minor functionality impacted | Non-critical service issues, moderate performance issues | 4 hours |
| **P3 - Low** | No immediate user impact | Monitoring alerts, capacity warnings | Next business day |

### Impact Assessment

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Critical** | All users affected, core functionality unavailable |
| **High** | Many users affected, important functionality unavailable |
| **Medium** | Some users affected, workarounds available |
| **Low** | Few users affected, minimal impact |

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection and Alerting

#### Automated Detection
- **Monitoring Systems**: Prometheus, Grafana alerts
- **APM Tools**: Application performance monitoring
- **Log Analysis**: ELK stack anomaly detection
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Uptime checks and user journey tests

#### Manual Detection
- **User Reports**: Support tickets, social media
- **Team Reports**: Engineering team observations
- **Partner Reports**: External service provider alerts

### 2. Initial Response (First 15 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions
```bash
# 1. Acknowledge the incident
curl -X POST https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents/{incident_id}/acknowledge

# 2. Check service health
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -v Running
curl -s http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=up | jq

# 3. Check recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/api-gateway
argocd app get api-gateway

# 4. Initial impact assessment
curl -s http://grafana:3000/api/dashboards/uid/platform-overview
```

#### Communication
1. **Create Incident Channel**: `#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM`
2. **Initial Status**: Post in `#platform-alerts`
3. **Stakeholder Notification**: Notify leadership if P0/P1
4. **Status Page Update**: Update public status page

### 3. Investigation and Diagnosis

#### Systematic Approach
1. **Timeline Analysis**: When did the issue start?
2. **Change Analysis**: What changed recently?
3. **Log Analysis**: What do the logs show?
4. **Metric Analysis**: What metrics are abnormal?
5. **Dependency Analysis**: Are external services affected?

#### Investigation Commands
```bash
# Check recent changes
git log --oneline --since="1 hour ago"
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

# Analyze logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/api-gateway --since=1h
curl -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/app-logs-*/_search" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "@timestamp": {
        "gte": "now-1h"
      }
    }
  },
  "sort": [{"@timestamp": {"order": "desc"}}],
  "size": 100
}'

# Check metrics
curl -s "http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(http_requests_total[5m])"
curl -s "http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))"
```

### 4. Mitigation and Resolution

#### Immediate Mitigation Options

##### Service Issues
```bash
# Scale up replicas
kubectl scale deployment/api-gateway --replicas=10

# Restart problematic pods
kubectl rollout restart deployment/api-gateway

# Rollback recent deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-gateway

# Enable circuit breakers
curl -X POST http://api-gateway:8080/admin/circuit-breaker/enable

# Redirect traffic
kubectl patch service api-gateway -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"stable"}}}'
```

##### Database Issues
```bash
# Check database connections
kubectl exec -it postgres-0 -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Kill long-running queries
kubectl exec -it postgres-0 -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' AND query_start < now() - interval '5 minutes';"

# Switch to read replica
kubectl patch configmap app-config -p '{"data":{"database_url":"postgres://read-replica:5432/app"}}'
```

##### Infrastructure Issues
```bash
# Check node health
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node <node-name>

# Drain and replace unhealthy nodes
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
aws autoscaling terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group --instance-id <instance-id> --should-decrement-desired-capacity

# Check cluster resources
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces
```
