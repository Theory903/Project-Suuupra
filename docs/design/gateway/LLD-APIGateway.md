# Low-Level Design: API Gateway Service

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive capability set for the custom API Gateway and explains the why/how/what behind each feature. It also proposes a phased delivery plan aligned with platform priorities.

## 2. Scope & Non-Goals

- Scope: Edge gateway for request routing, authn/z, traffic management, AI-aware proxying, cloud-native integration, observability, and admin UX.
- Non-goals: Full-featured WAF implementation, full CDN implementation, or building a general-purpose mesh. The gateway integrates with these, not replaces them.

## 3. Architecture Overview

- Core: Fastify/Node.js, with `http/https` proxying, `opossum` for circuit breaking, Redis for rate limiting and quotas, optional Kafka for traffic replay, OpenTelemetry for tracing, Prometheus for metrics.
- Extensibility: Plugin/middleware hooks that can be hot-loaded; Admin API to CRUD routes/services.
- Deployment: Kubernetes-native; compatible with Ingress; supports GitOps config sync.

## 4. Feature Matrix (What + Why + How)

### 4.1 Core Gateway Capabilities
