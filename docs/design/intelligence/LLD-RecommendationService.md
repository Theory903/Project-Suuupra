# Low-Level Design: Recommendation Service

## 1. 🎯 Overview

This document provides the low-level design for the **Recommendation Service**. This service is responsible for providing personalized content recommendations to users.

### 1.1. Learning Objectives

-   Implement collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
-   Use a graph database (Neo4j) for recommendations.
-   Use a vector database for similarity search.

## 2. 🏗️ Architecture

Our recommendation engine uses a hybrid approach, combining several techniques:

-   **Collaborative Filtering**: We use a **graph-based approach** with Neo4j to find users with similar tastes.
-   **Content-Based Filtering**: We use a **vector database** to find content that is similar to content a user has liked in the past.
-   **Real-time Personalization**: We use a real-time feature store to update user profiles and recommendations in real-time.

## 3. 🗄️ Database Schema

### 3.1. Neo4j (Graph Database)

```cypher
// User-Item-Interaction Graph
(:User {id: 1})-[:LIKED]->(:Content {id: 101, title: "..."})
(:User {id: 1})-[:VIEWED]->(:Content {id: 102, title: "..."})
```

### 3.2. Vector Database

We use a vector database to store embeddings for our content. This allows us to perform efficient similarity searches.

## 4. 🚀 Recommendation Pipeline

1.  **Candidate Generation**: We generate a set of candidate recommendations from multiple sources (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, etc.).
2.  **Ranking**: We use a machine learning model to rank the candidates based on their predicted relevance to the user.
3.  **Filtering**: We filter out content that the user has already seen or is not interested in.
