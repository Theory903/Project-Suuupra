# Low-Level Design: Live Streaming Architecture

## 1. 🎯 System Overview

This document details the low-level design of our live streaming architecture, which supports two primary use cases:
1.  **Interactive Live Classes**: Small to medium-sized groups with a high degree of real-time interaction (e.g., Zoom).
2.  **Mass Live Streaming**: Large-scale broadcasts to millions of concurrent viewers (e.g., Hotstar).

### 1.1. Key Requirements

- **Concurrent Viewers**: 10M+ for mass streaming.
- **Latency**: <100ms for interactive sessions, <3s for mass streaming.
- **Quality**: Adaptive bitrate streaming from 360p to 4K.
- **Global Reach**: <2s startup time worldwide.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover.

## 2. 🏗️ Streaming Architecture Components

### 2.1. WebRTC SFU for Interactive Sessions

For interactive sessions, we use a **Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)** architecture with **WebRTC**.

**Why an SFU?**
- An SFU receives each participant's video stream once and forwards it to all other participants. This is much more efficient than a mesh architecture where each participant sends their stream to every other participant.
- It allows for better server-side control, such as recording, moderation, and analytics.

**Technology Choice: Mediasoup**
- **Why Mediasoup?**: It's a powerful, flexible, and low-level WebRTC SFU library that gives us fine-grained control over the media pipeline.

```typescript
// WebRTC SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) implementation
class WebRTCSFU {
    // ... (Implementation details as before)
}
```text

### 2.2. Mass Live Streaming (HLS/DASH)

For mass live streaming, we use a more traditional architecture based on **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)** and **DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)**.

**Why HLS/DASH?**
- **Scalability**: They are based on standard HTTP, which is easy to scale with CDNs.
- **Client Support**: They are supported by virtually all modern browsers and devices.
- **Adaptive Bitrate**: They allow the client to switch between different quality levels based on network conditions.

**Technology Choices**: **Go** for the high-performance ingestion and segmentation service, and **FFmpeg** for video transcoding.

```go
// Mass streaming service for Hotstar-like scale
type MassStreamingService struct {
    // ... (Implementation details as before)
}
```text

### 2.3. CDN Management and Global Distribution

We use a **multi-CDN strategy** to ensure global reach and high availability.

**Why Multi-CDN?**
- **Performance**: We can route users to the best-performing CDN for their location.
- **Resilience**: If one CDN has an outage, we can failover to another.
- **Cost Optimization**: We can route traffic to the most cost-effective CDN.

```python
# Multi-CDN orchestration for global streaming

class CDNManager:
    // ... (Implementation details as before)
```text

## 3. 🧠 Media Processing Algorithms

### 3.1. Adaptive Bitrate Control

Our adaptive bitrate (ABR) engine dynamically adjusts the video quality based on the user's network conditions.

**How it works**:
1.  We transcode the source video into multiple quality levels (e.g., 360p, 720p, 1080p).
2.  The client-side player monitors network conditions (bandwidth, latency, buffer health).
3.  The player requests the appropriate quality level from the CDN.

### 3.2. Content-Aware Encoding

To optimize our transcoding process, we use **content-aware encoding**. This means we analyze the video content to determine the optimal encoding settings.

**Example**: A high-motion action scene requires a higher bitrate than a static talking-head scene to achieve the same perceptual quality.

## 4. 🔒 Security

### 4.1. DRM (Digital Rights Management)

To protect our content from piracy, we use **DRM** technologies like **Widevine** and **FairPlay**.

**How it works**:
1.  The video content is encrypted.
2.  The client requests a license from a license server to decrypt and play the content.

### 4.2. Token-Based Access Control

We use **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** to secure our streaming URLs. This ensures that only authorized users can access our content.

---

## 5. 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

We collect real-time analytics to monitor the health of our streaming infrastructure and the quality of experience for our users.

**Key Metrics**:
- **Concurrent Viewers**: The number of users watching a stream at any given time.
- **Startup Time**: The time it takes for a video to start playing.
- **Buffer Health**: The amount of video buffered by the client.
- **Dropped Frames**: The number of video frames that are not displayed to the user.

This low-level design provides a detailed blueprint for our live streaming architecture, covering both interactive and mass-scale streaming use cases.
