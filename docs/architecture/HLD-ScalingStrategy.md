# High-Level Design: Scaling Strategy for a Billion Users

## 1. üöÄ Scale Requirements & Philosophy

Our goal is to build a system that can gracefully scale to support a billion users. This requires a proactive approach to scalability, where every component is designed with massive growth in mind.

**Philosophy**: "Design for 10x the expected load, and have a plan for 100x."

**Target Scale Metrics**:
-   **Global User Base**: 1 Billion+
-   **Concurrent Users**: 100 Million+
-   **Request Volume**: 10 Million+ RPS (Requests Per Second)
-   **Data Volume**: 100 PB+ (Petabytes)
-   **Video Streaming**: 10 Million+ concurrent streams
-   **Payment TPS**: 1 Million+ (Transactions Per Second)

## 2. üåê Horizontal Scaling Architecture

Horizontal scaling (scaling out) is our primary strategy. We will add more machines to our resource pool to handle increased load, rather than increasing the resources of a single machine (vertical scaling).

**Why Horizontal Scaling?**
-   **Elasticity**: We can easily add or remove instances to match demand.
-   **Fault Tolerance**: The failure of a single node does not bring down the entire system.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness**: It's often cheaper to add many small machines than one large one.

### 2.1. Service-Level Scaling Patterns

Different services have different scaling characteristics.

| Service Category | Scaling Strategy        | Key Bottlenecks                  | Scale Solutions                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**  | Stateless Horizontal    | Network I/O, TLS Termination     | Load Balancing, Connection Pooling, Edge Termination  |
| **Identity**     | Database-Centric        | Auth Queries, Session Storage    | Read Replicas, Redis Clustering, Database Sharding    |
| **Content**      | Cache-Heavy             | Search Queries, Metadata Retrieval | Elasticsearch Sharding, CDN, Multi-level Caching      |
| **Payments**     | Consistency-Critical    | Database Writes, Fraud Detection | Database Sharding, Async Processing, ML Pipeline Scaling |
| **Streaming**    | Bandwidth-Intensive     | Video Encoding, CDN Distribution | Edge Computing, Multi-CDN, Distributed Transcoding    |
| **Analytics**    | Computation-Heavy       | Stream Processing, OLAP Queries  | Kafka Partitioning, ClickHouse Clustering, Flink Scaling |

### 2.2. Auto-Scaling with Kubernetes

We use Kubernetes' **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** to automatically scale the number of pods in a deployment based on observed metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics.

**Example HPA Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: api-gateway-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-gateway
  minReplicas: 10
  maxReplicas: 1000
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Custom
    pods:
      metric:
        name: requests_per_second
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: "1000"
```

## 3. üóÑÔ∏è Database Scaling Strategies

Databases are often the hardest part of a system to scale. We use a combination of techniques.

### 3.1. Sharding (Partitioning)

For our largest datasets, we will use **sharding** to partition the data across multiple database servers. Each server holds a subset of the data.

**Why Sharding?**
-   It allows us to scale our write throughput beyond the capacity of a single server.

**Sharding Strategies**:
-   **User Data**: We will shard the `Identity Service` database by `user_id` using a consistent hashing algorithm to ensure even distribution.
-   **Time-Series Data**: For analytics data in **ClickHouse**, we will partition by time (`toYYYYMM(timestamp)`) and then by a hash of the `user_id`.

### 3.2. Read Replicas

For read-heavy workloads, we use **read replicas**. A read replica is a copy of the master database that can be used to serve read queries.

**Why Read Replicas?**
-   They offload read traffic from the master database, allowing it to focus on writes.
-   They can be placed in different geographic regions to reduce read latency for users.

### 3.3. Connection Pooling

We use **PgBouncer** for PostgreSQL to manage a pool of database connections. This is crucial for performance at scale, as creating a new database connection for every request is expensive.

## 4. ‚ö° Caching Architecture at Scale

Caching is essential for reducing latency and database load.

**Multi-Level Caching Strategy**:
-   **L1 (Application Cache)**: An in-memory cache within each service instance for frequently accessed, non-critical data.
-   **L2 (Distributed Cache)**: A **Redis Cluster** for shared data that needs to be accessed by multiple service instances.
-   **L3 (CDN)**: A **Content Delivery Network** (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to cache static assets and media content close to our users.

**Cache Invalidation**:
-   **Write-Through with Event-Driven Invalidation**: When data is updated, we write it to the cache and the database simultaneously. We then publish a cache invalidation event to a Kafka topic, which is consumed by other services to invalidate their local caches.

## 5. üåç Geographic Distribution

### 5.1. Multi-Region Architecture

We deploy our services to multiple AWS regions to provide low latency to our global user base and for disaster recovery.

-   **Primary Regions**: Full deployments of all services and master databases.
-   **Secondary Regions**: Read replicas of our databases and CDN edge nodes.

### 5.2. Load Balancing at Scale

-   **Global Load Balancing (Route 53)**: We use AWS Route 53 for DNS-based global load balancing, with geo-routing to direct users to the nearest region.
-   **Regional Load Balancing (ALB)**: We use AWS Application Load Balancers to distribute traffic across our services within a region.
-   **Service Mesh (Istio)**: We use Istio for fine-grained traffic management between our microservices.

## 6. üìà Performance Optimization Patterns

### 6.1. Service-Specific Optimizations

-   **Payment Service**: We use a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent payment processes, preventing the system from being overwhelmed.
-   **Content Delivery**: We use an adaptive bitrate engine to select the optimal video quality for a user based on their network conditions and device.

### 6.2. Resilience Patterns

-   **Circuit Breaker**: To prevent a failing service from cascading failures to other services.
-   **Bulkhead**: To isolate failures in one part of the system from affecting others.
