# High-Level Design: Security Architecture

## 1. üõ°Ô∏è Security Vision & Principles

**Vision**: To build a platform that is secure by design, protecting our users' data and our system's integrity as a top priority. Our security posture must be able to withstand attacks from sophisticated actors at a global scale.

**Core Security Principles**:
- **Defense in Depth**: We employ multiple layers of security controls, so that if one layer is breached, others are in place to thwart an attack.
- **Zero Trust**: We never trust, always verify. All users, devices, and services must be authenticated and authorized before being granted access to resources.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and services are only granted the minimum level of access required to perform their functions.
- **Secure by Design**: Security is not an afterthought; it is an integral part of our design and development process.
- **Automation**: We automate security processes wherever possible to reduce human error and ensure consistency.

## 2. üîê Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM is the foundation of our security architecture.

### 2.1. Authentication: OAuth 2.0 & OIDC

We use **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** as our primary authentication and authorization protocols.

**Why OAuth 2.0/OIDC?**
- **Industry Standard**: They are the modern standards for authentication and authorization.
- **Flexibility**: They support a wide variety of client types (web apps, mobile apps, single-page apps).
- **Security**: They provide a secure way to delegate access to resources without sharing user credentials.

**Authentication Flow**:
Our authentication flow uses the **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**, which is the most secure OAuth 2.0 flow for public clients like web and mobile apps.

### 2.2. Authorization: RBAC & ABAC

We use a combination of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**.

- **RBAC**: For coarse-grained authorization based on a user's role (e.g., `student`, `instructor`, `admin`).
- **ABAC**: For fine-grained authorization based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment (e.g., a user can only edit a course if they are the author).

### 2.3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

We support multiple MFA factors to provide strong authentication:
- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Using authenticator apps like Google Authenticator.
- **SMS**: Sending a one-time code to the user's phone.
- **Push Notifications**: Sending a push notification to a trusted device.

## 3. üîí API Security

### 3.1. API Gateway Security

Our **API Gateway** is the first line of defense for our APIs. It enforces several security controls:

- **Authentication**: It validates JWTs for all incoming requests.
- **Rate Limiting**: It protects our services from denial-of-service attacks and abuse.
- **Input Validation**: It validates all incoming requests against an OpenAPI specification to prevent malformed requests from reaching our services.

### 3.2. Input Validation and Sanitization

We perform strict input validation at the edge (API Gateway) and within each service to prevent common vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.

## 4. üîê Data Security

### 4.1. Encryption

- **Encryption in Transit**: All data is encrypted in transit using **TLS 1.3**.
- **Encryption at Rest**: All data is encrypted at rest using **AES-256**. We use **envelope encryption** with a **Key Management Service (KMS)** for an extra layer of security.

### 4.2. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

We use a DLP scanner to detect and redact sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, Social Security numbers) in our logs and other non-essential data stores.

---

## 5. üõ°Ô∏è Application Security

### 5.1. Payment Security (PCI DSS)

We are **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** compliant. This means we follow strict security controls to protect cardholder data.

- **Tokenization**: We do not store raw credit card numbers. Instead, we use a third-party vault to tokenize them.
- **HSM (Hardware Security Module)**: We use an HSM to encrypt sensitive payment data.

### 5.2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

We use a strict **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded by a web page.

---

## 6. üîç Security Monitoring and Incident Response

We use a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** system to collect and analyze security events from across our platform. We use a combination of rule-based and ML-based detection to identify threats in real-time and automate our incident response.
