# High-Level Design: Deployment Topology

## 1. üåç Global Infrastructure Architecture

Our deployment strategy is designed for global scale, high availability, and low latency. We use a multi-region architecture to serve users from a location close to them and to provide disaster recovery.

### 1.1. Multi-Region Deployment Strategy

**Why Multi-Region?**
- **Low Latency**: Serving users from a nearby region significantly reduces network latency.
- **High Availability**: If one region fails, we can failover to another, ensuring the platform remains available.
- **Compliance**: Some countries have data sovereignty laws that require user data to be stored within the country's borders.

    end

### 1.2. Regional Architecture Deep Dive

Each region is built on a foundation of multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to protect against single data center failures.

**Why Multiple AZs?**
- An AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. Using multiple AZs for our primary services ensures high availability.

        I[Internet Gateway]
    end

    subgraph Load Balancing
        ALB[Application Load Balancer]
    end

    subgraph Availability Zone 1
        EKS1[EKS Worker Nodes]
        RDS_M[RDS Master]
    end

    subgraph Availability Zone 2
        EKS2[EKS Worker Nodes]
        RDS_R[RDS Replica]
    end

    subgraph Availability Zone 3
        EKS3[EKS Worker Nodes]
        EC[ElastiCache]
    end

    I --> ALB
    ALB --> EKS1
    ALB --> EKS2
    ALB --> EKS3
    EKS1 --> RDS_M
    EKS2 --> RDS_R
    EKS3 --> EC

## 2. ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Cluster Architecture

We use **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** to manage our containerized applications.

**Why Kubernetes?**
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Portability**: It allows us to run our applications on any cloud provider or on-premises.
- **Ecosystem**: Kubernetes has a vast and mature ecosystem of tools and services.

### 2.1. EKS Node Groups

We use different node groups for different types of workloads to optimize cost and performance.

- **System Nodes**: For running critical system components like the Kubernetes control plane, CoreDNS, etc.
- **Application Nodes**: For running our general-purpose microservices.
- **Compute-Intensive Nodes**: For CPU-bound workloads like ML inference.
- **Memory-Intensive Nodes**: For memory-bound workloads like our analytics services.

### 2.2. Service Mesh Architecture (Istio)

We use **Istio** as our service mesh to manage the communication between our microservices.

**Why a Service Mesh?**
- **Traffic Management**: Istio provides advanced traffic management capabilities like canary releases, A/B testing, and fault injection.
- **Security**: It provides secure service-to-service communication with mTLS, and fine-grained authorization policies.
- **Observability**: Istio provides detailed metrics, logs, and traces for all service-to-service communication.

## 3. üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

We use a **GitOps** workflow with **ArgoCD** for our CI/CD pipeline.

**Why GitOps?**
- **Declarative**: The desired state of our system is declared in Git, which acts as the single source of truth.
- **Automated**: ArgoCD automatically syncs the state of our cluster with the state declared in Git.
- **Auditable**: All changes to our system are tracked in Git, providing a complete audit trail.

### 3.1. GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

Our CI pipeline is built with **GitHub Actions**. It is responsible for:
- Building container images.
- Running tests.
- Performing security scans.
- Pushing images to our container registry.

### 3.2. ArgoCD Application Configuration

We use **ArgoCD** to deploy our applications to Kubernetes. We also use **Argo Rollouts** for progressive delivery strategies like canary releases.

## 4. üìä Monitoring and Observability Stack

We use the three pillars of observability to monitor our system:

- **Metrics**: **Prometheus** for collecting metrics and **Grafana** for visualization.
- **Logging**: The **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for centralized logging.
- **Distributed Tracing**: **Jaeger** for distributed tracing.

---

## 5. üîß Environment-Specific Configurations

We maintain separate configurations for our different environments (`development`, `staging`, `production`) to ensure that we can test our changes in a production-like environment before deploying them to production.
