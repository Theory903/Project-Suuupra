# Master Build Script for Suuupra EdTech Platform
#
# This script iterates through all microservice directories in `/services`
# and executes the `build.sh` script within each one. This provides a
# single command to build all Docker images for the platform locally.
#
# Usage:
# ./scripts/build-all.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Must be run from the project root.
# - Each service directory must contain a `build.sh` script.
# ==============================================================================

set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -o pipefail # Return the exit status of the last command in the pipe that failed.

# --- Configuration ---
SERVICES_DIR="services"
SCRIPT_NAME="build.sh"

# --- Main Logic ---
