# Per-Service Operations (standardized scripts):

# In any service directory (e.g., services/api-gateway/)
./build.sh      # Build the service
./test.sh       # Run all tests
./deploy.sh     # Deploy to environments
./migrate.sh    # Run database migrations
```

## 📡 Communication Patterns

| Type      | Protocols                            | Use Case                                                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asynchronous** | **Kafka** (Primary)             | Cross-domain business events, service decoupling (e.g., `user.registered`) |
| **Synchronous**  | **gRPC** (Internal)              | High-performance, low-latency internal service-to-service requests      |
| **Synchronous**  | **REST / OpenAPI** (External)    | External client-facing APIs, third-party integrations                 |
| **Real-time**    | **WebSocket, WebRTC, SSE**       | Live updates, interactive sessions, streaming                         |

### 🗂️ Shared Schemas and Contracts

The `shared/` directory is the **single source of truth** for all cross-service contracts, ensuring consistency and type safety across the platform.

- **`shared/proto`**: Contains all gRPC service definitions (`.proto` files). Services use these to generate client and server stubs.
- **`shared/events`**: Contains all asynchronous event schemas (e.g., Avro, Protobuf). This ensures that event producers and consumers agree on the event structure.

---

## 📈 Observability & Performance

**Monitoring Stack:**
- 🟢 **Prometheus**: Metrics + Service availability
- 📉 **Grafana**: Custom dashboards in `/infrastructure/monitoring/grafana`
- 📍 **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry
- 🔔 **Alerting**: Prometheus AlertManager + K8s probes

**Service Level Objectives (SLOs):**
| Service | Latency (p99) | Throughput | Availability | Error Rate |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| API Gateway | 150ms | 50k RPS | 99.9% | < 0.1% |
| Payment Gateway | 500ms | 10k TPS | 99.99% | < 0.01% |
| Live Streaming | 100ms RTT | 1M viewers | 99.9% | < 0.5% |
| Search Service | 300ms | 15k QPS | 99.5% | < 1% |
| Recommendation | 400ms | 25k RPS | 99% | < 2% |

---

## 🧪 Testing + CI/CD

| Layer        | Tools             |
|--------------|------------------|
| Unit         | JUnit, Jest, Pytest, Go test |
| Integration  | Testcontainers, Postgres/Mongo mock |
| Contracts    | Pact (consumer-driven)        |
| Load Testing | k6 (`/tools/testing/k6`)       |

```bash
make test
# or per-service:

./services/payments/scripts/test.sh
```

GitHub Actions handle CI/CD, scans, tests, and deploy on commit.

## 🔐 Multi-Layer Security Architecture

**Authentication & Authorization:** ✅ **Production Ready**
- OAuth2/OIDC with JWT tokens (ES256) and refresh rotation
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP with encrypted secrets, backup codes)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with tenant scoping and fine-grained permissions
- WebAuthn/Passkeys support with step-up authentication
- API rate limiting with distributed token buckets and lockout policies

**Data Protection:** ✅ **Vault Integration Complete**
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data (AES-256 with KEK management)
- TLS 1.3 for all communication channels with HTTPS enforcement
- Secrets management with HashiCorp Vault (automated setup scripts)
- PII anonymization and GDPR compliance

**Payment Security:**
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliance
- Card tokenization and secure vault storage
- HSM integration for cryptographic operations
- Real-time fraud detection with ML models

**Content Security:**
- DRM integration for premium content protection
- Watermarking for content piracy prevention
- Content moderation with AI and human review
- DMCA compliance and takedown procedures

## 🚦 Implementation Phases & Status

We will follow a phased approach to building the Suuupra platform. Each phase delivers a meaningful set of features. Refer to the **Services Matrix** for the current status of each service.

### 🔒 Production Readiness (Cross‑Cutting)
- Content service: Models and APIs for content, courses, lessons, media assets; strict TypeScript build passes; JWT via JWKS; deployable via Docker Compose/Helm. Background ES sync worker is lazy-loaded and can be enabled via feature flag.
- Global CI/CD: Enforce lint, typecheck, unit/integration tests, security scans, and image signing.
- Security: Vault-backed secrets, least-privilege IAM, rate limiting, and S2S auth.
- Observability: OTEL tracing, Prometheus metrics, RED dashboards, and probes.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Services**
**Goal**: To lay the foundation for the entire platform by building the core infrastructure and services. See the `Foundation` phase in the Services Matrix for current status.

### **Phase 2: Payments & Commerce**
**Goal**: To build the e-commerce and payment processing capabilities of the platform. See the `Payments` phase in the Services Matrix for current status.

### **Phase 3: Streaming & Media Systems**
**Goal**: To build the live streaming and video-on-demand capabilities of the platform. See the `Media` phase in the Services Matrix for current status.

### **Phase 4: AI, Search & Intelligence**
**Goal**: To build the AI-powered features of the platform. See the `Intelligence` phase in the Services Matrix for current status.

### **Phase 5: Supporting Services**
**Goal**: To build the supporting services that are used by all other services. See the `Supporting` phase in the Services Matrix for current status.
