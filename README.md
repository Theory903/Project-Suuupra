## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✳️ Requirements
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for local development
- **Node.js 22.18.0** (managed via nvm)
- **Python 3.13.5** (managed via pyenv)
- **Go Latest** (managed via gvm)
- **Java 17+**, **Rust Latest** (for Live Tracking)
- **FFmpeg** for media processing
- **kubectl, terraform, ArgoCD CLI** for infrastructure

### ⏯️ Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/suuupra-edtech-platform.git
cd suuupra-edtech-platform
docker-compose up -d
./tools/scripts/initialize-project.sh

# Per-Service Operations (standardized scripts):
# In any service directory (e.g., services/api-gateway/)
./build.sh      # Build the service
./test.sh       # Run all tests
./deploy.sh     # Deploy to environments
./migrate.sh    # Run database migrations
```

---

## 🛠 Development Workflow

### Create a New Service

```
./tools/scripts/generate-service.sh my-service java
```

- Supported stacks: `go`, `java`, `node`, `python`
- Template includes: API Scaffold, Infra, Tests, CI Config

## 📡 Communication Patterns

| Type      | Protocols                            |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| API       | REST / OpenAPI                        |

| Unit         | JUnit, Jest, Pytest, Go test |
| Integration  | Testcontainers, Postgres/Mongo mock |
| Contracts    | Pact (consumer-driven)        |
| Load Testing | k6 (`/tools/testing/k6`)       |

```
make test
# or per-service:
./services/payments/scripts/test.sh
```

GitHub Actions handle CI/CD, scans, tests, and deploy on commit.
