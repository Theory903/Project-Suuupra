## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✳️ Requirements

- **Docker & Docker Compose** for local development
- **Node.js 22.18.0** (managed via nvm)
- **Python 3.13.5** (managed via pyenv)
- **Go Latest** (managed via gvm)
- **Java 17+**, **Rust Latest** (for Live Tracking)
- **FFmpeg** for media processing
- **kubectl, terraform, ArgoCD CLI** for infrastructure

### ⏯️ Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/suuupra-edtech-platform.git
cd suuupra-edtech-platform
docker-compose up -d
./tools/scripts/initialize-project.sh

# Per-Service Operations (standardized scripts):

# In any service directory (e.g., services/api-gateway/)
./build.sh      # Build the service
./test.sh       # Run all tests
./deploy.sh     # Deploy to environments
./migrate.sh    # Run database migrations
```text

## 📡 Communication Patterns

| Type      | Protocols                            |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| API       | REST / OpenAPI                        |
| Internal  | gRPC + REST (hybrid microservices)    |
| Events    | Kafka + RabbitMQ                      |
| Realtime  | WebSocket, WebRTC, SSE                |

## 📈 Observability & Performance

**Monitoring Stack:**
- 🟢 **Prometheus**: Metrics + Service availability
- 📉 **Grafana**: Custom dashboards in `/infrastructure/monitoring/grafana`
- 📍 **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry
- 🔔 **Alerting**: Prometheus AlertManager + K8s probes

**Service Level Objectives (SLOs):**
| Service | Latency (p99) | Throughput | Availability | Error Rate |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| API Gateway | 150ms | 50k RPS | 99.9% | < 0.1% |
| Payment Gateway | 500ms | 10k TPS | 99.99% | < 0.01% |
| Live Streaming | 100ms RTT | 1M viewers | 99.9% | < 0.5% |
| Search Service | 300ms | 15k QPS | 99.5% | < 1% |
| Recommendation | 400ms | 25k RPS | 99% | < 2% |

---

## 🧪 Testing + CI/CD

| Layer        | Tools             |
|--------------|------------------|
| Unit         | JUnit, Jest, Pytest, Go test |
| Integration  | Testcontainers, Postgres/Mongo mock |
| Contracts    | Pact (consumer-driven)        |
| Load Testing | k6 (`/tools/testing/k6`)       |

```text
make test
# or per-service:

./services/payments/scripts/test.sh
```text

GitHub Actions handle CI/CD, scans, tests, and deploy on commit.
