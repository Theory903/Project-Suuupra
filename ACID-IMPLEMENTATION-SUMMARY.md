## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Bank Simulator Service (Node.js/TypeScript)

**Core Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Real ACID transaction processing with Prisma
- ✅ Multi-bank simulation (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Kotak)
- ✅ Account management with proper validation
- ✅ Daily limit tracking and enforcement
- ✅ VPA mapping and resolution
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging
- ✅ gRPC and REST API endpoints
- ✅ Prometheus metrics integration
- ✅ Structured logging with correlation IDs

**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Core tables with ACID guarantees
- banks (bank registry)
- accounts (customer accounts with balance tracking)
- transactions (complete transaction history)
- vpa_mappings (VPA to account mapping)
- daily_limits (daily transaction limits)
- audit_logs (complete audit trail)
```

**Transaction Flow**:
1. Request validation and bank verification
2. Account status and balance validation
3. Daily limit and KYC checks
4. ACID transaction execution with Prisma
5. Balance updates with row locking
6. Audit logging and metrics recording
7. Response with complete transaction details

### UPI Core Service (Go)

**Core Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Complete UPI transaction orchestration
- ✅ VPA resolution with Redis caching
- ✅ Bank routing and load balancing
- ✅ Cryptographic signature verification
- ✅ Settlement processing framework
- ✅ Event-driven architecture with Kafka
- ✅ Distributed locking for coordination
- ✅ Idempotency key management
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with circuit breakers

**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- ACID-compliant schema
- banks (participating bank registry)
- vpa_mappings (VPA to account resolution)
- transactions (authoritative transaction log)
- transaction_state_changes (state audit trail)
- settlement_batches (batch settlement processing)
- bank_settlements (individual bank positions)
- idempotency_keys (exactly-once processing)
- audit_logs (complete system audit)
- distributed_locks (coordination mechanism)
```

**Transaction Processing Pipeline**:
1. **Validation Phase**: Request validation and VPA resolution
2. **Authorization Phase**: Bank availability and account verification  
3. **Execution Phase**: Coordinated debit/credit with compensating transactions
4. **Settlement Phase**: Transaction recording and state management
5. **Notification Phase**: Event publishing and audit logging

## 🔄 End-to-End Transaction Flow

### Complete ACID Transaction Sequence

```
1. UPI Core receives transaction request
   ├── Idempotency check (avoid duplicates)
   ├── Request validation (business rules)
   └── VPA resolution (with Redis cache)

2. Bank availability verification
   ├── Payer bank health check
   ├── Payee bank health check  
   └── Circuit breaker status

3. **ATOMIC EXECUTION BEGINS**
   ├── Database transaction started
   ├── Transaction record created (PENDING)
   └── Audit log entry

4. Payer bank debit processing
   ├── Account validation and locking
   ├── Balance and limit verification
   ├── Debit execution with ACID guarantees
   └── Updated balance returned

5. Payee bank credit processing  
   ├── Account validation
   ├── Credit execution
   └── Success confirmation
   
   **OR** Compensating transaction on failure:
   ├── Credit failure detected
   ├── Automatic debit reversal initiated
   ├── Payer balance restored
   └── Transaction marked as REVERSED

6. **ATOMIC EXECUTION COMPLETES**
   ├── Transaction status updated (SUCCESS/FAILED/REVERSED)
   ├── Database transaction committed
   └── Final audit log entry

7. Post-processing (asynchronous)
   ├── Settlement batch assignment
   ├── Event publishing to Kafka
   ├── Metrics recording
   └── Cache updates
```
