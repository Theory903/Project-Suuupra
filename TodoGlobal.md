-  **Detailed TODOs**:
    -   [API Gateway](./services/api-gateway/TODO.md) - Enhanced with JWT validation
    -   [Identity Service](./services/identity/TODO.md) - **Production Ready** ðŸš€
    -   [Content Service](./services/content/TODO.md)

### **Phase 2: Payments & Commerce (Weeks 7â€“12)**

**Goal**: To build the e-commerce and payment processing capabilities of the platform.

-  **Key Services**: `Commerce`, `Payments`, `Ledger`
-  **Detailed TODOs**:
    -   [Commerce Service](./services/commerce/TODO.md)
    -   [Payment Gateway](./services/payments/TODO.md)
    -   [Ledger Service](./services/ledger/TODO.md)

### **Phase 3: Streaming & Media Systems (Weeks 13â€“18)**

**Goal**: To build the live streaming and video-on-demand capabilities of the platform.

-  **Key Services**: `Live Classes`, `VOD`, `Mass Live`, `Creator Studio`
-  **Detailed TODOs**:

## 5. ðŸ§­ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  **Run the setup script**: `./tools/scripts/initialize-project.sh`
3.  **Deploy Identity Service (Production Ready)**: 
    - Kubernetes: `./deploy-prod.sh` (with Vault integration)
    - Docker Compose: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
    - Local Dev: `docker-compose up -d api-gateway identity-service`
4.  **Explore the documentation**: Start with the `docs/architecture` directory to understand the high-level design of the platform.
5.  **Try the Identity Service**: Visit `http://localhost:8081/.well-known/openid-configuration` for OIDC discovery
6.  **Pick a service**: Choose a service from the implementation roadmap and start working on the tasks in its `TODO.md` file.
